0,00001.wav,Chinese,True Story,"2021年的冬天,我回了一趟老家探望外婆。那年她身体不好,住在离村子不远的小镇医院里。冬天的风特别刺骨,我拎着一袋她喜欢吃的水果走进了医院。外婆见到我时,脸上露出了久违的笑容。她说,你怎么知道我最想吃的就是橙子?我们在病房里聊了很多,我问她治疗的怎么样,她却总是岔开话题,说家里最近的事情,比如新盖的房子,种下的几棵果树。我能看出她在努力表现得很坚强,但也能感受到她眼中藏不住的疲惫。下午的时候,我推着她的轮椅到医院后面的花园。冬天的阳光很淡,却让人觉得温暖。外婆静静地看着那些枯黄的树叶,忽然开口问我,你是不是觉得时间过得太快了?我没回答,因为我也有同样的感受。她开始讲起年轻时候的故事,说她当年如何背着我母亲翻过一座山去找工作,又如何在最艰难的时候种田养家,我听着这些故事,心里忽然觉得很愧疚。愧疚于自己平时总觉得工作忙,没时间回来看她,而她却从未抱怨我不常回家。离开医院的时候,我回头看了看花园里的她,阳光落在她的白发上,我心里想着,以后无论多忙,我都要经常回来看她,因为陪伴才是最好的。这是她最需要的东西。","In the winter of 2021, I went back to my hometown to visit my grandmother. That year she was not in good health and lived in a small town hospital not far from the village. The winter wind is particularly piercing, and I walked into the hospital carrying a bag of fruits that she likes to eat. When my grandmother saw me, a long lost smile appeared on her face. She said, 'How do you know that the one I want to eat the most is oranges?'? We talked a lot in the ward, and when I asked her how her treatment was, she always changed the subject and talked about recent things at home, such as the newly built house and the few fruit trees planted. I can see that she is trying hard to appear strong, but I can also feel the exhaustion that cannot be hidden in her eyes. In the afternoon, I pushed her wheelchair to the garden behind the hospital. The winter sunshine is very light, but it makes people feel warm. Grandma quietly looked at the withered yellow leaves and suddenly asked me, do you think time passes too quickly? I didn't answer because I feel the same way too. She began to tell stories from her youth, about how she carried my mother over a mountain to find a job, and how she had to farm and support her family during the toughest times. Listening to these stories, I suddenly felt guilty. I feel guilty that I always feel busy with work and don't have time to come back to see her, but she never complains that I don't come home often. When I left the hospital, I turned back to look at her in the garden. The sunshine fell on her white hair, and I thought to myself, no matter how busy I am in the future, I will come back to see her often because companionship is the best. This is what she needs the most.","2021年的冬天,我回了一趟老家探望外婆。那年她身体不好,住在离村子不远的小镇医院里。冬天的风特别刺骨,我拎着一袋她喜欢吃的水果走进了医院。外婆见到我时,脸上露出了久违的笑容。她说,你怎么知道我最想吃的就是橙子?我们在病房里聊了很多,我问她治疗的怎么样,她却总是岔开话题,说家里最近的事情,比如新盖的房子,种下的几棵果树。我能看出她在努力表现得很坚强,但也能感受到她眼中藏不住的疲惫。下午的时候,我推着她的轮椅到医院后面的花园。冬天的阳光很淡,却让人觉得温暖。外婆静静地看着那些枯黄的树叶,忽然开口问我,你是不是觉得时间过得太快了?我没回答,因为我也有同样的感受。她开始讲起年轻时候的故事,说她当年如何背着我母亲翻过一座山去找工作,又如何在最艰难的时候种田养家,我听着这些故事,心里忽然觉得很愧疚。愧疚于自己平时总觉得工作忙,没时间回来看她,而她却从未抱怨我不常回家。离开医院的时候,我回头看了看花园里的她,阳光落在她的白发上,我心里想着,以后无论多忙,我都要经常回来看她,因为陪伴才是最好的。这是她最需要的东西。"
1,00002.wav,Chinese,True Story,"2022年暑假,我终于实现了去云南旅行的梦想。云南的美景和独特文化一直是我向往的,而这次旅行让我深深感受到它的魅力。最让我难忘的是在尔海边骑行的一天,那种自由和宁静的感觉至今难忘。清晨,我从大理古城租了一辆自行车,沿着尔海的湖边小道骑行。尔海的水面在清晨时分如镜子般平静,倒映着周围的青山和天上的白云。清风轻轻吹过,湖面泛起点点涟漪。阳光洒在水面上,整个画面仿佛是从画中走出来的。我边骑车边拍照,不时停下来欣赏眼前的美景。一路上,我遇到了许多同样骑行的游客,有的来自南方,有的来自国外。大家都被尔海的宁静之美所折服。中午,我在湖边的一家小餐厅停下,品尝了地道的云南美食,特别是当地的烤乳扇。外焦里嫩,奶香浓郁,让人异口难忘。下午,我继续骑行,一路欣赏尔海的不同角度。有些地方可以看到渔船在湖面上缓缓划过,有些地方则被稻田和小村庄环绕,每一处风景都令人流连忘返。半晚时分,我在尔海边的观景台坐下,夕阳染红了整个湖面,渔船归航的景象安静而美丽,我感受到一种前所未有的宁静与满足。这次旅行,不只在湖面上,也在海边上。这次旅行,不只在湖面上,也在海边上。不仅让我看到了尔海的美,也让我更懂得如何在生活中找到内心的宁静。","In the summer of 2022, I finally realized my dream of traveling to Yunnan. The beautiful scenery and unique culture of Yunnan have always been my dream, and this trip has deeply impressed me with its charm. The most unforgettable day for me was riding by the seaside, the feeling of freedom and tranquility that remains unforgettable to this day. In the morning, I rented a bike from Dali Old City and rode along the lake path of Erhai. The water surface of Erhai is as calm as a mirror in the early morning, reflecting the surrounding green mountains and white clouds in the sky. The gentle breeze blows, causing ripples to appear on the surface of the lake. The sunlight shines on the water, and the whole picture seems to come out of the painting. I take photos while riding my bike, occasionally stopping to appreciate the beautiful scenery in front of me. Along the way, I met many tourists who rode the same bike, some from the south and some from abroad. Everyone was impressed by the peaceful beauty of Erhai. At noon, I stopped at a small restaurant by the lake and tasted authentic Yunnan cuisine, especially the local roasted milk fan. It is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, with a rich milk aroma that leaves an unforgettable impression. In the afternoon, I continued cycling and enjoyed different angles of Erhai along the way. In some places, fishing boats can be seen slowly gliding over the lake, while in others, rice paddies and small villages surround each other, making every scenery unforgettable. Halfway through the night, I sat down at the observation deck by the seaside. The sunset dyed the entire lake red, and the scene of fishing boats returning home was quiet and beautiful. I felt an unprecedented sense of tranquility and satisfaction. This trip is not only on the lake, but also by the seaside. This trip is not only on the lake, but also by the seaside. Not only did it show me the beauty of Erhai, but it also taught me how to find inner peace in life.","2022年暑假,我终于实现了去云南旅行的梦想。云南的美景和独特文化一直是我向往的,而这次旅行让我深深感受到它的魅力。最让我难忘的是在尔海边骑行的一天,那种自由和宁静的感觉至今难忘。清晨,我从大理古城租了一辆自行车,沿着尔海的湖边小道骑行。尔海的水面在清晨时分如镜子般平静,倒映着周围的青山和天上的白云。清风轻轻吹过,湖面泛起点点涟漪。阳光洒在水面上,整个画面仿佛是从画中走出来的。我边骑车边拍照,不时停下来欣赏眼前的美景。一路上,我遇到了许多同样骑行的游客,有的来自南方,有的来自国外。大家都被尔海的宁静之美所折服。中午,我在湖边的一家小餐厅停下,品尝了地道的云南美食,特别是当地的烤乳扇。外焦里嫩,奶香浓郁,让人异口难忘。下午,我继续骑行,一路欣赏尔海的不同角度。有些地方可以看到渔船在湖面上缓缓划过,有些地方则被稻田和小村庄环绕,每一处风景都令人流连忘返。半晚时分,我在尔海边的观景台坐下,夕阳染红了整个湖面,渔船归航的景象安静而美丽,我感受到一种前所未有的宁静与满足。这次旅行,不只在湖面上,也在海边上。这次旅行,不只在湖面上,也在海边上。不仅让我看到了尔海的美,也让我更懂得如何在生活中找到内心的宁静。"
2,00003.wav,Chinese,True Story,"这是我的故事。我的旅程从著名的故宫开始,它是世界上最大保存最完整的皇宫建筑群。当我踏入那巨大的红色宫门时,仿佛穿越到了历史中。精美的雕刻,金碧辉煌的屋顶和广阔的庭院展现了明清皇朝的辉煌气势。在游览太和殿和御花园时,我对这里的建筑工艺丰富的历史着着着迷。接着,我前往距离市区不远的长城沐浴田段,这段长城以壮丽的景色和较少的游客而闻名。攀登过程虽然辛苦,但站在顶端遥望绵延的山岭和延伸的长城,所有的疲惫都烟消云散。站在这座古老的防御工程上,我感受到了一种穿越千年的震撼。回到市中心,我参观了天安门广场,这是世界上最大的广场之一。广场的规模,壮观规模令人震撼,我花了一些时间沉思它的文化和历史意义。不远处,我还参观了天坛,一座明代的建筑杰作。那原型的祈年殿,即壮观的建筑。这座明代的建筑,又象征了天人合一的理念。北京的美食同样的严深,我品尝了著名的北京烤鸭。这道传承百年的美味令我回味无穷。厨师娴熟的切片,薄脆的鸭皮和柔嫩的鸭肉,搭配薄饼和甜面酱,简直是味觉的盛宴。晚上,我漫步在热闹的胡同里,这些狭窄的巷子展现了北京传统的一面。小院子街边的小吃摊和特色小吃摊,让我感觉到当地人的生活真实与悠闲。北京是一种充满对比的城市,古老的传统和现代的创新在这里交织。每一刻都像一段精彩的故事,我很幸运能成为它的一部分。","This is my story. My journey begins with the famous Forbidden City, which is the largest and most well preserved imperial palace complex in the world. When I stepped into the huge red palace gate, it felt like I had traveled back in time. Exquisite carvings, magnificent roofs, and vast courtyards showcase the glorious momentum of the Ming and Qing dynasties. When visiting the Hall of Supreme Harmony and the Imperial Garden, I was fascinated by the rich history of architectural craftsmanship here. Next, I headed to the Bathing Field section of the Great Wall, which is not far from the city center and is known for its magnificent scenery and relatively few tourists. Although the climbing process was arduous, standing at the top and gazing at the stretching mountains and the extended Great Wall, all exhaustion dissipated into thin air. Standing on this ancient defense project, I felt a shock that lasted for thousands of years. Returning to the city center, I visited Tiananmen Square, which is one of the largest squares in the world. The scale of the square is breathtaking, and I spent some time contemplating its cultural and historical significance. Not far away, I also visited the Temple of Heaven, a masterpiece of Ming Dynasty architecture. The prototype of the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests is a magnificent building. This Ming Dynasty building also symbolizes the concept of harmony between heaven and man. The cuisine in Beijing is equally authentic, and I tasted the famous Beijing roast duck. This delicious dish that has been passed down for a hundred years leaves an endless aftertaste for me. The chef's skillful slicing, crispy duck skin, and tender duck meat, paired with thin pancakes and sweet sauce, is simply a feast for the taste buds. At night, I stroll through the bustling alleys, which showcase the traditional side of Beijing. The street side snack stalls and specialty snack stalls in Xiaoyuanzi make me feel the authentic and leisurely life of the locals. Beijing is a city full of contrasts, where ancient traditions and modern innovation are intertwined. Every moment is like a wonderful story, and I am fortunate to be a part of it.","这是我的故事。我的旅程从著名的故宫开始,它是世界上最大保存最完整的皇宫建筑群。当我踏入那巨大的红色宫门时,仿佛穿越到了历史中。精美的雕刻,金碧辉煌的屋顶和广阔的庭院展现了明清皇朝的辉煌气势。在游览太和殿和御花园时,我对这里的建筑工艺丰富的历史着着着迷。接着,我前往距离市区不远的长城沐浴田段,这段长城以壮丽的景色和较少的游客而闻名。攀登过程虽然辛苦,但站在顶端遥望绵延的山岭和延伸的长城,所有的疲惫都烟消云散。站在这座古老的防御工程上,我感受到了一种穿越千年的震撼。回到市中心,我参观了天安门广场,这是世界上最大的广场之一。广场的规模,壮观规模令人震撼,我花了一些时间沉思它的文化和历史意义。不远处,我还参观了天坛,一座明代的建筑杰作。那原型的祈年殿,即壮观的建筑。这座明代的建筑,又象征了天人合一的理念。北京的美食同样的严深,我品尝了著名的北京烤鸭。这道传承百年的美味令我回味无穷。厨师娴熟的切片,薄脆的鸭皮和柔嫩的鸭肉,搭配薄饼和甜面酱,简直是味觉的盛宴。晚上,我漫步在热闹的胡同里,这些狭窄的巷子展现了北京传统的一面。小院子街边的小吃摊和特色小吃摊,让我感觉到当地人的生活真实与悠闲。北京是一种充满对比的城市,古老的传统和现代的创新在这里交织。每一刻都像一段精彩的故事,我很幸运能成为它的一部分。"

I participated in this trip to the United States with my other two classmates and many teachers and classmates. After arriving in New York, USA on January 15th, all our travels were taken by bus. I had a very sumptuous breakfast with my classmates. It's a Chinese restaurant. I am familiar with steamed buns, dumplings, Congee, and Mantou for breakfast. Afterwards, we took a bus together and watched the American scenery on the street along the bus. I saw a Starbucks in the United States and a Gothic building in the car, and I even took photos to commemorate it. Afterwards, my classmates and I visited Columbia University for sightseeing. The university square is very extensive. The sunlight shining on the lawn is very pleasing to the eye. It was winter at the time, so we strolled around Columbia University wearing down jackets. I have seen the distinctive buildings of different colleges, including the School of Philosophy and the School of Law. I also saw pigeons walking on the ground, a very harmonious and beautiful scene. The statue of Athena, the goddess of wisdom at Columbia University, is very dignified and beautiful. I feel very happy during this visit. However, after the university visit, my classmates, teachers, and I took a group photo in front of this statue as a memento. Afterwards, we took a bus to Wall Street. I touched the famous golden bull statue. I heard that touching its horn can bring me wealth, which is also a beautiful symbolism. I also took a photo in front of this golden bull statue as a souvenir. Afterwards, my team and I took a cruise to observe the Statue of Liberty. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't have felt its magnificence and beauty. Sure enough, the feeling that pictures give people is completely different from what they see with their own eyes. The Statue of Liberty seen on site is truly magnificent. In the sunlight, it held up a torch as if fighting for freedom. I stayed in the United States for a total of seven days before returning home. I feel that this trip was very exciting and meaningful.","在2020年,我报名参加了学校组织的美国严选活动。我跟我的另外两个同学以及许多老师同学们一起参加了这次美国旅行。在1月15号我们抵达的美国纽约之后的旅行都是乘坐大巴进行的。我跟我同学一起吃了一顿非常丰盛的早餐。那是一家中式餐厅,早餐有我熟悉的包子,饺子,粥,还有馒头之类的。之后,我们一起乘坐大巴,沿着大巴看街上的美国风景。我在车上看到了美国本土的星巴克以及一个哥特什的建筑,我还拍照纪念下来。之后,我跟我同学一起来到哥伦比亚大学进行参观游览。大学的广场非常广泛。阳光洒在草坪上,非常赏心悦目。当时是冬天,所以我们穿着羽绒服漫步在哥伦比亚大学里。我看到了不同学院的各具特色的建筑,包括哲学院的和法学院的。我还看到有鸽子在地面上散步,非常和谐美好的一幕。哥伦比亚大学智慧女神雅典娜雕像非常的端庄素美。在这次的参观,我感到很高兴。但是,大学的参观结束之后,我跟我同学还有老师们一起在这个雕像面前合影留念。之后,我们坐大巴去到了华尔街。我摸到了著名的金牛雕像。听说摸了它的牛角,它能为我带来财富,也算是一个美好的寓意了。我也在这个金牛雕像面前合影留念了。之后,我跟我的团队一起乘坐游轮去观摩自由女神像。若不是亲眼所见,我是一定不会感受到它的壮观和美丽的。果然,图片带给人的感觉跟亲眼看的完全不一样。现场看到的自由女神像,那叫一个蔚为壮观的。在阳光下,它高举着火炬,像是在抗争为了自由。我总共在美国待了七天就回国了。我感觉这次的旅行非常精彩,并且很有意义。"
4,00005.wav,Chinese,True Story,"今天我想和大家分享我去年的陕西之旅,当我踏上这片古老的土地,心中充满了期待与敬畏。我在陕西之旅的第一站是西安,这座千年古都仿佛述说着历史的沧桑。漫步在古城墙上,我仿佛能听到历史的回音,每一块砖石都承载着厚重的历史。我走进兵马俑博物馆,那一列列栩栩如生的陶俑,让我感受到了秦始皇统一六国的霸气与辉煌。接着,我来到了新华宫,这里曾是唐玄宗与杨贵妃的爱情见证地。漫步在温泉旁,我仿佛看到他们当年在此嬉戏的场景,感受到那份跨越千年的浪漫。当然,陕西美食也是不容错过的。这一碗热腾腾的羊肉泡馍,让我品尝到了当地地道的风味,那浓郁的汤汁,鲜嫩的羊肉,还有那香脆的模块,每一口都让我回味无休。这次的陕西之旅,让我深刻感受到了中华文明的博大精深,从古老的城墙到壮观的兵马俑,从浪漫的清华宫到美味的羊肉泡馍。每……陕西的每一个地方都让我流连忘返。在这……陕西,在这片深溪的土地,不仅让我领略了历史的厚重,更让我感受到了中华文化的魅力。我相信,每一个来到陕西的人,都会被这里的魅力所折服。每一个来到陕西的人,在他有生之年内都会再次希望来到陕西,这座历史…………悠久的城市。人代 erg形容是笔触,在 Dharma appearance 中称为—— reciprocity.","Today, I would like to share with you my trip to Shaanxi last year. As I stepped onto this ancient land, my heart was filled with anticipation and awe. My first stop on my trip to Shaanxi was Xi'an, a thousand year old ancient capital that seems to narrate the vicissitudes of history. Strolling along the ancient city walls, I feel like I can hear the echoes of history, as every brick and stone carries a heavy weight of history. When I walked into the Terra Cotta Warriors Museum, I felt the hegemony and glory of Qin Shihuang's unification of the six countries through the lifelike terracotta warriors. Then, I arrived at Xinhua Palace, which was once a witness to the love between Emperor Xuanzong of Tang and Yang Guifei. Strolling by the hot springs, I seem to see the scene of them playing here back then, and feel the romance that spans thousands of years. Of course, Shaanxi cuisine is also not to be missed. This bowl of hot Pita bread soaked in Lamb Soup gave me a taste of the local flavor. The rich soup, fresh mutton, and crispy modules left me with endless aftertaste. This trip to Shaanxi made me deeply feel the breadth and depth of Chinese civilization, from the ancient city walls to the spectacular Terra Cotta Warriors, from the romantic Qinghua Palace to the delicious Pita bread soaked in Lamb Soup. Every place in Shaanxi makes me linger and forget to leave. In Shaanxi, in this land of deep streams, not only did I appreciate the weight of history, but I also felt the charm of Chinese culture. I believe that everyone who comes to Shaanxi will be impressed by the charm here. Every person who comes to Shaanxi will hope to come to Shaanxi again in their lifetime, this city with a long history.

Whether it's the scenery, climate, or culture, Nanjing satisfies me so much. For someone who grew up in the north, Nanjing is the most beautiful image of a southern city in their imagination. Wander on Yihe Road during the most beautiful season. On a sunny day, the sun shines through the wings of the leaves. The wind is weak. The mottled light and shadow spilled on the stone bricks. These buildings come from the Republican era. Like the wutong tree that can't forget the end of the road. It truly lives up to the good intentions of the Republic of China when it stumbled upon the Yihe Road. Nanjing is a city that connects ancient and modern times.

6,00007.wav,Chinese,True Story,"去年秋天,在国庆假期期间,我去了杭州,来访了一个多年未见的朋友。这次旅程对我来说非常特别,因为杭州是我一直想去还没有去的地方。而这位朋友是我的高中同学,我们自从上大学后就各自忙碌,再也没有见面。那天,我一早坐上去杭州的高铁,车窗外的景色,从繁华的城市如也变成青山绿水,一路上我充满期待。到达杭州后,朋友在车站接我,我们见面的那一刻,彼此都笑了,仿佛回到了高中时光。他带我去了他推荐的那条老街,那是一条非常安静的步行街,两旁是老旧的房屋和小商铺,他说这里保留了他在大学时期两年的记忆,是他最喜欢的地方之一。我们在街边小银座下,和立凡之后获得规划无粉,那种淡淡的甜美和规划的香气,让我感受到一种家的温暖。我慢慢走在老街上,看着那些卖手工艺品的小摊,朋友给我讲述了他在这里两年大学时期发生的故事。他说每当难过时,或有什么开心的事情,都会来这条步行街三星游玩。我看着他的笑容,仿佛也看到了他,当时在这条街的样子。下午的时候,我们去了西湖,湖边的柳树已经略微泛黄,湖水在阳光下闪烁着金色的光芒。我们租了一只小船,慢悠悠的划到湖心,湖面上风很轻,带着淡淡的凉意。朋友和我聊了很多,关于他大学生活,他的兴趣爱好,还有他对未来的打算。我们也聊起了高中时的点点滴滴,那些有密集,宝月被咬一处的游玩的日子,时间过得很快,夕阳渐渐西沉,湖面上微染上一片橙红色。那天晚上,我们在湖边的小饭馆吃了一顿晚餐,虽然只是一顿家常菜,但因为有老朋友的陪伴,显得额外美味。饭后,我们散步在湖边,看着远处的灯火,倒影在湖边上,像是无数的星星洒落在水中,我深吸一口气,感觉这一刻的宁静和美好,将永远留在我记忆中。","Last autumn, during the National Day holiday, I went to Hangzhou and visited a friend whom I hadn't seen in many years. This journey is very special to me because Hangzhou is a place I have always wanted to go to but haven't. And this friend is my high school classmate. Since we started college, we have been busy on our own and haven't seen each other again. That day, I boarded the high-speed train in Hangzhou early in the morning, and the scenery outside the window transformed from a bustling city to lush mountains and clear waters. Along the way, I was full of anticipation. After arriving in Hangzhou, my friend picked me up at the station. At the moment we met, we both smiled, as if we were back in high school. He took me to the old street he recommended, which is a very quiet pedestrian street lined with old houses and small shops. He said it preserves his memories of two years in college and is one of his favorite places. We met at the small Ginza on the street, and after getting together with Lifan, we obtained a plan without fans. The faint sweetness and fragrance of planning made me feel a warmth of home. I slowly walked on the old street, watching the small stalls selling handicrafts. My friend told me the story of his two years of college here. He said that whenever he felt sad or had something happy, he would come to this pedestrian street to visit Samsung. I looked at his smile as if I also saw him, what he looked like on this street at that time. In the afternoon, we went to West Lake. The willow trees by the lake had already turned slightly yellow, and the lake was shining with a golden light in the sunlight. We rented a small boat and paddled slowly to the center of the lake. The wind on the surface of the lake was very light, with a faint coolness. My friend and I talked a lot about his college life, his hobbies, and his plans for the future. We also talked about the bits and pieces of our high school days, those days of intensive play where Baoyue was bitten. Time passed quickly, as the sunset gradually set and the lake surface was slightly tinged with orange red. That night, we had dinner at a small restaurant by the lake. Although it was just a home cooked meal, it was extra delicious with the company of old friends. After dinner, we took a walk by the lake, watching the distant lights reflecting on the lake, like countless stars falling in the water. I took a deep breath and felt the tranquility and beauty of this moment, which will forever remain in my memory.","去年秋天,在国庆假期期间,我去了杭州,来访了一个多年未见的朋友。这次旅程对我来说非常特别,因为杭州是我一直想去还没有去的地方。而这位朋友是我的高中同学,我们自从上大学后就各自忙碌,再也没有见面。那天,我一早坐上去杭州的高铁,车窗外的景色,从繁华的城市如也变成青山绿水,一路上我充满期待。到达杭州后,朋友在车站接我,我们见面的那一刻,彼此都笑了,仿佛回到了高中时光。他带我去了他推荐的那条老街,那是一条非常安静的步行街,两旁是老旧的房屋和小商铺,他说这里保留了他在大学时期两年的记忆,是他最喜欢的地方之一。我们在街边小银座下,和立凡之后获得规划无粉,那种淡淡的甜美和规划的香气,让我感受到一种家的温暖。我慢慢走在老街上,看着那些卖手工艺品的小摊,朋友给我讲述了他在这里两年大学时期发生的故事。他说每当难过时,或有什么开心的事情,都会来这条步行街三星游玩。我看着他的笑容,仿佛也看到了他,当时在这条街的样子。下午的时候,我们去了西湖,湖边的柳树已经略微泛黄,湖水在阳光下闪烁着金色的光芒。我们租了一只小船,慢悠悠的划到湖心,湖面上风很轻,带着淡淡的凉意。朋友和我聊了很多,关于他大学生活,他的兴趣爱好,还有他对未来的打算。我们也聊起了高中时的点点滴滴,那些有密集,宝月被咬一处的游玩的日子,时间过得很快,夕阳渐渐西沉,湖面上微染上一片橙红色。那天晚上,我们在湖边的小饭馆吃了一顿晚餐,虽然只是一顿家常菜,但因为有老朋友的陪伴,显得额外美味。饭后,我们散步在湖边,看着远处的灯火,倒影在湖边上,像是无数的星星洒落在水中,我深吸一口气,感觉这一刻的宁静和美好,将永远留在我记忆中。"

We haven't seen each other for several years, and my heart is filled with anticipation and tension, and perhaps it's also a longing for him. When I walked into his house, I almost felt the atmosphere of playing together back then. Our people here call friends who have been playing from childhood to adulthood 'hairless'. This feeling is very wonderful, it was when we grew up watching each other from a young age. The photos on the wall still capture countless happy moments of our time. Then I saw Xiaoyu walk out of his bedroom, and we met with a smile. For some reason, our past happiness suddenly surged in our hearts, but at the same time, there was also a hint of melancholy mixed in. We have indeed all grown up. And then, we can't go back either. Things are no longer that simple now. We sat on the balcony and talked about some funny stories from our childhood. He mentioned that we used to catch fish together by the small river, and the rest of the afternoon was filled with waves. I couldn't help but laugh out loud, but at that moment, I felt a hint of sadness. Time has passed, and we can never go back to that carefree age. We now have our own studies and tasks to attend to. Our lives are no longer the same, and our lives are no longer the same. Our lives are no longer the same, and our lives are no longer the same. Our lives are no longer the same, and our lives are no longer the same. There may also be a sad barrier between us. I think this is a rather sad thing, but there's nothing I can do about it. As I bid farewell, I suddenly felt a complex emotion in my heart, both the joy of reunion and the nostalgia for the past. This visit made me understand that although time has changed everything, there are also memories of the past.

Finally, I had the opportunity to personally experience the charm of this water city. I embarked on this journey with a few friends, and when we first arrived in this city, we were deeply impressed by the scenery before us. The streets of Venice are not in the traditional sense, with 28 year old waterways surrounding ancient buildings, like a painting of history. We eagerly boarded the traditional Venetian boat, the Gondola, and slowly sailed through the waterway. The boatman skillfully slid his feet, leading us through the complex of buildings with a strong sense of history. The water reflects the afterglow of the sunset, adding a touch of golden radiance to the surrounding scenery, making the city appear peaceful and mysterious. In addition to the Duogong Dora tour, we also visited St. Mark's Square, one of the most famous squares in Venice, where people live in ruins. Pigeons in the city circle fly in the air and occasionally land on the ground, attracting tourists for food. The square is surrounded by buildings at the end of the line, and the golden roof of St. Mark's Church shines brightly in the sunlight. At the St. Mark's factory, we met an artist who painted portraits of tourists. I asked him to paint a portrait of me, and the artist smiled respectfully at the request and began to depict it in detail. The square is surrounded by buildings at the end of the line, and the golden roof of St. Mark's Church shines brightly in the sunlight. The studio is filled with the aroma of coffee and melodious music, and I am quietly waiting. After finishing the painting, the artist handed me the portrait, in which I looked more vivid and interesting than the real me. This encounter left a deep impression on me. In this city with a long history, all moments carry a mysterious color, especially those that happen unintentionally. It makes travel more real and unforgettable.","去年,我去了意大利的威尼斯旅行,这是我梦寐以求的旅行,终于有机会亲自感受这座水上城市的魅力。我和几个朋友一起踏上了这趟旅程,刚到这座城市时,我们都被眼前的景色深深震撼。威尼斯的街道并不是传统意义上的街道,28年的水道,环绕着古老的建筑,宛如进入历史的画卷。我们迫不及待地坐上了宫多拉这种传统的威尼斯小船,缓缓地穿行在水道上。船夫熟练地滑动着脚,带领我们穿过那些有厚重历史感的建筑群。水面上倒映着夕阳的余晖,给周围的景色增添了几分金色的光辉,这座城市显得宁静而神秘。除了多宫多拉之旅,我们还参观了圣马克广场,这是威尼斯最著名的广场之一,广场上人生顶废。城市圈的鸽子在空中飞翔,不时落在地上,吸引游客们为食。广场周围是行尾的建筑,圣马克教堂的金色连顶在阳光下,熠熠生辉。在圣马克工厂上,我们遇到了一位画游客肖像的艺术家。我让他为我画了一幅肖像,艺术家微笑地敬服了请求,开始细致地描绘。广场周围是行尾的建筑,圣马克教堂的金色连顶在阳光下,熠熠生辉。画室充满了咖啡的香气和悠扬的音乐,我在静静等待着。画完后,艺术家递给我那幅肖像,画中的我看起来比真实的我更加生动而有趣。这次偶遇给我留下了深刻的印象。在这座历史悠久的城市,所有的瞬间都带着神秘的色彩,尤其是那些不经意间发生的插曲。它让旅行变得更加真实和难忘。"

Xiao Jun was my best friend during my college years, and we spent many wonderful times together. At that time, we often swayed and reviewed together, discussed our life ideals, and dreamed of conveying the world together after graduation. However, after graduation, we each embarked on different paths and gradually lost touch. Every time I think of him, I feel a little regretful, but we all know that life always takes people further and further away. Until one day, I received a message from his family that Xiao Jun had fallen seriously ill and his condition was very bad. Upon hearing this news, my heart was filled with helplessness and anxiety, and I decided to go see him as soon as possible. When I arrived at Xiaojun's house, I saw him lying on the sickbed with almost unrecognizable hands. Although he forced a smile, there was a deep exhaustion in his eyes. We sat in front of his hospital bed, chatting about the time we spent together before. He gently said that he had been waiting for me to come and see him because he knew I wouldn't abandon him. At that moment, I felt like a stone pressing down on my heart, unable to breathe. Xiao Jun handed me a notebook and said it was written by him during this period, which recorded his past memories, his friendship with us, and his helplessness towards the future. He said that if one day he left on his own, I hope I can remember him and also remember those beautiful moments from the past. Upon hearing these words, I could hardly control my tears, but I could only try my best to appear strong and imagine saying, 'You will definitely get better.'. That night, we sat side by side in the yard, listening to the distant bell and wind. The air was a bit cold, but he still didn't want me to leave and held me back. I promised him that I wouldn't come back to see him again next time. However, when we said goodbye, I never had the chance to say to him the words' you will definitely get better 'again. A few months later, Xiaojun passed away. When I received the news, my heart was empty, as if I had lost a friend who could never be married back. I opened the table he was paying attention to, holding my notebook and reading those words as if he were beside me, everything so real yet so distant. Every time I see those things I talk about him, my heart surges with pain. Perhaps we can only cherish them after losing them.","在2021年的秋天,我去探望了一位很久没见的朋友小军。小军是我大学时期最好的朋友,我们一起度过了很多美好的时光,在那时我们常常一起摇曳复习,讨论人生理想,梦想着毕业后能一起传达世界,然而毕业后我们各自走上了不同的道路,慢慢地失去了联系,每当我想到他总有些遗憾,但我们都知道,生活总是把人带得越来越远。直到有一天,我收到了他家人的消息,说小军得了重病,情况非常不好。听到这个消息,我内心充满了无助和焦虑,决定尽快去看他。我到达小军家时,看到他躺在病床上,手都几乎认不出来,虽然他勉强笑了笑,但眼神里透出了深深疲惫。我们坐在他的病床前,聊起了我们以前一起度过的那些时光,他轻轻地说,他一直在等我来看他,因为他知道我不会抛下他,那一刻,我感到心里像有一块石头压着,无法呼吸。小军递给我一本笔记本,说这是他这段时间写的,里面记录了他的过去的回忆,对我们的友谊,以及他对未来的无奈。他说,如果有一天他自己离开了,希望我能记住他,也记住曾经那些美好。听到这些话,我几乎控制不住眼泪,然而我只能尽力表现坚强,想象着说,你一定会好起来的。那天晚上,我们并肩坐在院子里,听着远处的钟声和风声,空气有些冷,但他依然不想我走,拉着我不放,我答应他下次不会回来再看他。然而再见的时候,我已经再也没有机会对他说那句你一定会好起来的话了。几个月后,小军去世了,我收到消息时心中空落落的,仿佛失去了一个永远无法嫁回来的朋友。我打开他留意的桌子,我拿着我的笔记本,读着那些文字,仿佛他在我身边,一切都那么真实,却又那么遥远。每当我看到那些关于他聊些的事,心中都会涌上阵阵痛楚,也许,我们总是在失去后才能珍惜。"

In my heart, the sea is a dream, a world full of blue and waves. Last summer, my friends and I planned a trip to Hainan and finally had the opportunity to fulfill our dream. When the plane landed at Sanya Airport, I couldn't wait to head towards the beach. The next morning, we woke up early and drove to Sanya Bay. As the car approached the coastline, I saw a deep blue ocean appear before my eyes. Its vastness and calmness made me hold my breath, and the sunlight sprinkled on the sea, like a layer of golden powder. My friends and I couldn't wait to get off the car and step on the soft beach, feeling the delicate touch of sand sliding through the paper manure. But by the beach, I heard the real sound of waves for the first time, which was both majestic and gentle, like a symphony of nature. My friends cheered while rushing towards the sea, and I rolled up my pants and cautiously walked in. The cool seawater soaked my ankles, and the waves gently brushed against my skin, bringing an indescribable sense of joy and novelty. We also rented a small boat to go out to sea, and the captain told us that dolphins can often be seen near the sea. After sailing on the sea for a while, several dolphins jumping in the distance caught our attention, and everyone excitedly shouted and eagerly picked up their phones to take photos. That day, we also tried beach volleyball and crab catching, and every moment was filled with laughter and excitement. As night fell, we sat on the beach watching the sunset. The orange red sunset dyed the sea golden, and the scenery was so beautiful that I didn't want to leave.

Germany's performance in recent years has not been very good, so the outside world generally does not have a positive outlook on them. But I still support the German team because they have many players that I like, and I have been supporting them since ten years ago. In today's group stage, the German team lost their first game to the very strong Spanish team in the same group. This has cast a shadow over the fans of the German team. However, in the following two matches, the German team, along with Japan and Belgium, ultimately advanced to the second place in the group stage. In the knockout stage of the quarter finals, the German team's second group match is against the other group's first placed Argentina. In the semifinals, the German team ultimately ended the game with a score of 4-0. This score undoubtedly put many fans who were not optimistic about the German team in the face, as the German team advanced to the quarter finals with a very beautiful victory. Then in the semifinals, the German team defeated the popular Brazilian team 2-1 to win the championship. Successfully paused. In the semi-finals, the German team took over the group that had previously lost to the Spanish team, and ultimately came to a halt in the final. This makes many people believe that the German team is a dark horse in this World Cup. But I think the German team just showed their normal strength. In the final, the German team faced the former World Cup champions Italy. But in recent years, the Italian team's skills have also declined. Faced with the fierce attack of the German team, the Italian team ultimately lost the game 0-3. The German team finally lifted the long-awaited World Cup trophy and won the championship. This makes me very happy because I support the German team and they won the championship, which makes me very happy.

Paris is the city I have always longed for, full of romantic atmosphere and strong artistic atmosphere. It was a sunny afternoon, and I decided to explore the city and enjoy its charm. However, due to insufficient route planning in advance, I got lost on a strange street and my phone ran out of battery. Even worse, I don't understand French at all, so I don't know how to communicate with the locals. I stood on the roadside feeling a bit flustered and didn't know what to do. Just as I was feeling anxious, a middle-aged man walked up to me. He looked very friendly, wearing simple clothes and smiling. He saw that I was a bit confused, so he took the initiative to step forward and ask if I needed help. Seeing his smile, I felt a little relieved, so I told him that I was lost and my phone was out of battery, so I couldn't find my way back to the hotel. After hearing this, he smiled and said, 'No problem, come with me.' This stranger didn't hesitate at all and decided to help me. He took me to a nearby caf é, charged me, and told me how to take the subway back to the hotel with simple gestures and English. He even bought me a cup of coffee. He sat down with me to chat. Although we didn't speak the same language, we successfully established communication through body language and smiles. At this moment, I felt no longer a lonely tourist, but received warm care from others. Through this experience, I deeply realized that goodwill between people transcends culture and language.

I saw him with a tiger like aura, writing very decisively and with recognition. After laughing heartily a few times, he wrote a few words. I took a closer look and found the four big characters' Learning Without End 'written on my mouth. At this moment, the old man spoke earnestly to me, 'There is no end to learning on the road of life.'. You should always maintain a humble and studious attitude in all aspects of life, including acquiring knowledge, improving personal cultivation, and so on. We should not be arrogant or complacent, but continue to pursue more knowledge and higher realms. Just like me. I have been studying all along. Just like how I write calligraphy with a brush. Writing an extra painting every day brings me an extra sense of emotion. There will always be new things waiting for you to learn and discover. I cannot write such excellent fonts today without my daily learning. Until now, I am still constantly learning and making progress. Speak up, the master gave me that word.

I remember standing in front of the ironic Weiner Library, taking photos, and imagining what it would be like to study here. During our guide tour, the student guide shared fascinating stories.

20,00021.wav,English,True Story,我想分享一个关于我日常生活的故事。我是一名大学生，我的日子很简单。它们充满了我的梦想和旋律。我的一天从宿舍里的闹钟开始。我迅速起床，梳洗干净，然后冲向图书馆。我喜欢图书馆。这是我一天学习的开始。当我打开书本，沉浸在知识的海洋中时，阳光透过窗户洒在我的桌子上。中午，我和朋友在自助餐厅见面。我们一起吃午饭，分享有趣的故事和学习经历。这些轻松的对话是我一天中快乐的源泉。下午，我通常会参加极限循环活动。有时这是一场篮球比赛。有时是学生会会议。这些活动让我重新回到了大学生活。晚上，我在校园通行证上散步，享受着白天最后的宁静。我用手机捕捉美丽的日落或路边盛开的鲜花。这些简单的时刻是最重要的。我有珍贵的回忆。晚上，我回到宿舍，整理笔记，为第二天的课做准备。睡前，我会花一些时间阅读或写日记，记录一天的细节。故事的最后，我总是在夜晚安静的时候回顾我一天中的每一刻。因此，每一天都显得平凡。我知道，这些旋律优美的日常生活正在编织成我生命中最美丽的场景。," I want to share a story about my daily life.

21,00022.wav,English,True Story,我去过的最拥挤的地方是北京地铁，尤其是在连顿，尤其是早晚高峰时段。更折磨人的是，我基本上每天都坐地铁旅行。每天早晚，我都会带着一车人挤进地下。地铁是到达那里的最快方式，而且仍然准时。由于北京是一个超级大都市，10年前的常住人口统计不到2000万，流动人口为2000万。所以当你这样想的时候，肯定没有……地铁里肯定没有足够的座位。基本上，在门打开的那一刻，每个人都会回去抢座位。有趣的是，在早晚高峰时段，如果你想上车，有一种有趣的说法，你所要做的就是闭上眼睛，不需要……在挤进车厢之前抬起腿。你不必担心没有扶手，因为有足够多的人让你站起来而不会摔倒。即使你没有抓住其他扶手，因为别人会把你推到一个坚固的地方。然后在早上和晚上，因此，当你应该上气不接下气，但不是很平静的时候，虽然没有迹象表明你现在可以下车了。然后是一个巨大的责任，真的。," The most crowded place I've ever been is Beijing Underground, especially in Lianton, especially during the morning and evening rush hours.

Because my younger brother didn't get together during the winter vacation and Chinese New Year due to the college entrance examination, he had to review his exam subjects and prepare for the exam, so we couldn't disturb him either. And now, looking at it, he did achieve a pretty good score in the college entrance examination. He will be conducting political experiments in Shanghai to study physics. And then it was that summer vacation, so I really miss him. After all, it's been too long since we last met. So when I went to play with him, I played all the games I didn't play in high school, like League of Legends and Five Flavor Contract. Just the two of us playing games together in a double row, I found it particularly interesting. Besides playing games, we will also go out and find some local specialties. I have tried everything from the famous Fish King Meat Banquet in Fuzhou to the aged crab noodles. Fuzhou's cuisine is particularly interesting, but one of the more famous ones is called SanSanqi, where there are a lot of snacks and local souvenirs. But my brother and I are both locals. So I'm not very familiar either. So I'm not very familiar either. That's to find some delicious food over there. And after playing that time, I felt particularly happy.

The scenery along the way was varied and intertwined, with trees, railways, grasslands, and even a few small rivers. We talked and laughed along the way, so the journey was not particularly boring. Okay, the first thing we do when we arrive at Qijin City is to taste the local iron pot stew. Although iron pot stew is more enjoyable to eat in winter, we have already gone there. Even in the summer, when we were so stuffy that we were sweating profusely, we still had to take a bite. The carefully prepared sauce there boiled all kinds of side dishes and wrapped them in a big pancake. Just thinking about this rice now, we still feel unsatisfied. Finally, we went to Changbai Mountain again because the cooler weather there allowed us to briefly escape from Beijing's steam ovens, and the scenery was very beautiful. Once in a hurried forest, and the air was very fresh, shuttling between clouds and mist felt like being in a fairyland. Then, there was a mountain spring and a few eagles hovering and flying by, as if we had received a embrace from nature. Afterwards, we went to have Northeast barbecue, where grilled skewers are a major specialty. It is said that there are no Northeasterners who are not good at grilling skewers, and the meat and dishes are very sincere, with just the right heat control. Unlike those low street vendors. We have eaten these meat skewers, which are both thin and hard. The skewers we have eaten can be described as fresh, fragrant, and delicious, with a combination of fat and thin, emitting hot air, and making a slight sizzling sound. Looking back now, it still makes my mouth water. Then we also tried several local specialty dishes, such as Third Fresh, Pan Bao Rou, and Beef Duan. Although these dishes can be found in takeout from various places, we can only taste the most authentic flavor in Northeast China. When stir fried and served, you can still bring out the sugar colored pan fried pork. Then there was the third dish that looked dark, but each dish was coated with a sauce that had been thickened, making it a perfect complement to the meal. The prices of the dishes there are relatively cheap, and there is no shortage of gold or silver. The bosses are very enthusiastic, and during the waiting period, they even bring us homemade pickled vegetables or appetizers, and chat with us about our daily lives. In our communication with the boss, even our accents have become a bit Northeastern. The influence of Northeast China on people's accents. This trip had some playful moments along the way, including the Star Mine Doctor standing on Changbai Mountain, and the ultimate enjoyment of authentic Northeastern cuisine.

What's different about this trip is that in the past, Beijing wasn't considered a hometown for me because I had to take the high-speed train every time to come here. But this time, it's different because I'm studying here, so I don't need to take the high-speed train. We played for about a week. At the beginning of the first year, we prepared to join our group, but later we thought about it and decided to choose a customized tour called Xiecheng, which is a chartered car, because we took care of many elderly and children in the team. I remember spending almost tens of thousands of yuan at that time, which felt quite expensive, but the experience wasn't that good either. There were some bad things that happened during the group tour, such as traffic restrictions, vehicles, and the car we booked couldn't arrive at our place in time. Also, the driver may have been a bit lazy and didn't want to pick us up. So although he gave us money, he didn't work hard for us. In the end, Xiecheng also gave us some compensation. So you have to ask me if I'm happy driving, it's just average because although he compensated me, I still feel a bit disappointed, so I still don't really like this itinerary. So in the end, we also went to many places, including Peking University, Changcheng, the Forbidden City, and many other places. Then I found that many places are actually not very easy to grab tickets, and if you want to grab tickets, you have to rely on speed. The most impressive place should be Universal Studios. Universal Studios is very interesting. There are many favorite movie characters, little yellow people, some wonderful characters, and other things in it. It's still very interesting. I remember on the last day, we went to the Forbidden City. Actually, I didn't think it was suitable to go there on the last day, but it was still the last day because you know it's difficult to grab tickets. So on the last day when I went to the Forbidden City, I remember someone wearing the emperor's clothes went in to take photos, and I thought this idea was quite novel. Well, overall, this is my last day at the Forbidden City. Well, overall, this is my last day at the Forbidden City. Well, overall, this is my last day at the Forbidden City.

Not only that, I also had the opportunity to meet basketball superstar LeBron James. All of this sounds like a dream, but as I stand in front of the Staples Center in Los Angeles, I can hardly believe my eyes. I am already a loyal fan of James. Since the season he first entered the league, I have been following his games and witnessing his glorious journey from Cleveland to Miami, back to Cleveland, and finally joining the Los Angeles Lakers to win multiple championships. To be able to see him with my own eyes, and even communicate with him face-to-face, is an unparalleled honor for me. That day, I arrived at the game venue early, and the atmosphere was filled with excitement and tension as the Lakers faced the Warriors. Fans gathered outside the door, excitedly discussing the game's predictions and players' performances. Finally, the staff took me into an area specially prepared for the media and VIP guests, where I could observe the team's preparation process up close. As I walked into the hallway of the players' locker room, I suddenly heard a heavy shaking sound. I turned around and saw the basketball superstar LeBron James whom I had admired since childhood. He was wearing a Lakers training uniform, holding a bottle of water, and walking towards the training ground. Although he looks very focused, he smiled slightly when he saw me, as if he was not unfamiliar with me. We started discussing basketball and also talked about his personal life. He told me that besides the challenges of playing on the field, family and social responsibility are the most important parts of his life. He mentioned that as an athlete, one may sometimes face immense pressure, but he always believes that with the support and unremitting efforts of the team, all difficulties can be overcome. I asked him, during your long career, when did you feel the most proud? James pondered and took a pat, then smiled slightly as he replied, 'My greatest pride is being able to bring back the championship trophy for my hometown Cleveland.'. That was the result of our team's hard work and also the most unforgettable moment of my career. Winning the championship is not just for myself, but for the fans and people in my hometown who have always supported me. In a short conversation, James left a deep impression on me. His humility, focus, and love for basketball far exceed what I know of him. He is not only a superstar on the field, but also full of wisdom and human touch off the field. When I bid farewell to him, I felt an indescribable sense of satisfaction. Being able to communicate face-to-face with great athletes like James is one of the most valuable experiences of my life. Although I know that characters like James may only have encountered each other once. But his focused and passionate spirit will always inspire me to constantly pursue my dreams. The game started, and I sat on the sidelines, staring closely at every moment on the ball. James' performance on the court was as stunning as usual, and in that moment off the court, his sincerity and humility deeply touched me. That's all, thank you.

That is because an investor should not choose such a place for his office. Even so, he appeared calm and told me that all the troubles were still running after the office. I started to feel that something was off. But when I turned around, the whole scene seemed unfamiliar. When I left, he said to me, You are always welcome to come back. We still have a lot to talk about. Until I left, I still couldn't decide if that night was real or not. especially when seeing his office looks."

The performance of ""The Legend of the White Snake"" has been adjusted based on the previous old script, with modifications made to the lyrics and melody, as well as the addition of more modern lighting and stage design, and more group performances and dances, making it more like an opera. This performance was performed by many famous actors and outstanding young actors, and the venue was packed with people. The atmosphere was also very lively. The actors' every move and gesture conveyed a unique feeling. The applause and cheers of the audience also echoed one after another, and the entire theater was filled with a joyful atmosphere. However, a small accident also occurred during the process. In the building scene of Shuidou, the actor who played Bai Suzhen may have been too nervous and had a small accident, causing her to choke. However, in the final performance, I still felt a bit regretful as I didn't hear my favorite singing piece. I later checked and found out that it was because there were some adjustments to the lyrics in this performance, so that section was adapted. And it's also very regrettable that this performance abandoned its previous intention, so I hope to see more complete white segments in the future and look forward to the next performance.","在今年的国庆节,我去国家大剧院观看了京剧白蛇传。本次白蛇传的演出针对之前的老剧本进行了调整,在唱词和曲调上有所修改,并且加入了更多现代化的灯光和舞美,加入了更多群演群舞的环节,使之变得更像歌剧。本次演出是由许多著名演员和优秀青年演员参演,演出现场座无虚席,气氛也是非常热烈。演员们的一招一式一唱一和,都透露出了独特的感觉。观众们的掌声和欢呼声也是此起彼伏,整个剧场都洋溢着欢乐的气氛。但是,在过程中也出现了一点小意外。在水豆的打楼戏中,饰演白素贞的演员可能是太紧张了,出了一点小意外,呛掉了。但,在终场演出中,我还是觉得有一些遗憾,就是没有听到我最喜欢的唱段。我后来去查了一下,是因为这次演出对唱词有所调整,所以说就将那一段进行了改编。并且也是非常遗憾,这次演出它是舍弃掉了之前的意向,所以我希望以后能看到更全的白色段,期待下次的演出。"

Every time I step out of the classroom, the piercing chill pierces my skin like a merciless blade, making it impossible to breathe. Even though it was so cold outside, the sunlight still mischievously streamed into the classroom through the window, quietly covering the desks. The light is gentle and brilliant, as if a warm friend gently caresses our hearts in the cold winter, bringing a hint of tranquility and comfort. Throughout the morning, we buried ourselves in our textbooks and homework, with our pens jumping rapidly on our notebooks, as if time had slipped away quietly without us noticing. Outside the window, the cold winter is quietly brewing a surprise. In our world, there are only knowledge points on the blackboard and tense reviews. And in my heart, there is no other space left. At that time, we didn't know that the beautiful moments of life always come unexpectedly. In the afternoon, the setting sun gradually faded away, the sky gradually dimmed, and the gray sky seemed to be foreshadowing what was about to happen. Suddenly, snowflakes danced wildly, and those snowflakes fell slowly like light feathers, seemingly the gentlest blessing in the sky. Gradually, Snowflake encountered the secret code. It's as if countless little elves are dancing joyfully in the sky, dancing and spinning with the melody of the wind. Every snowflake gently falling to the ground is a poetic line of nature. Poetry lines are all a touch of tenderness in winter. I couldn't help but put down the pen in my hand and gaze out at the snowy scenery outside the window. At that moment, my heart suddenly became unusually peaceful. All learners, I am thinking. All the study pressure and homework troubles disappear in this moment. Through the glass, I seem to be able to smell the fragrance of snowflakes, a scent that thoroughly purifies the soul. Snowflakes silently covered everything and washed away my inner restlessness, making me feel a long lost sense of ease and joy. As the snow grew heavier, the trees, playground, and even eaves on campus were covered. The whole world seems to be draped in a pure white veil, soft and quiet. The air was filled with the scent of snow, and everything became particularly clear and peaceful. At that moment, I couldn't help but start fantasizing. After class, I will run freely on the grass. Stepping on the soft snow, there was a creaking sound. The carefree and powerless joy, like sunshine, constantly flies over my body. The troubles in my heart, the troubles in my heart, the troubles in my heart, the troubles in my heart. The troubles in my heart, the troubles in my heart, the troubles in my heart. We are like a group of children who have lost their bonds, immersed in this snow-white world until the sky darkens. Recalling those snowflakes drifting across the ocean, I can still feel the heart that let go of all worries. I can still feel the heart that lets go of all my troubles. I can still feel the heart that lets go of all my troubles. That day was like washing away the dust from my heart, bringing endless joy and warmth.

The overall atmosphere is very relaxed, and I fell in love with it right away. What impressed me the most was that the locals were very friendly, which made our entire journey very enjoyable because they were very helpful. Of course, when we go to Chengdu, we must try Sichuan cuisine. For example, we went to many small restaurants and roadside stalls at that time. The most impressive thing must be hot pot. We also tasted Mapo tofu and Dandan noodles, which are particularly delicious, but too spicy, sometimes spicy. The most memorable stop in this death trip is.

In addition, we also went to the Kuanzhai Alley where there are many old-fashioned buildings, and tried some traditional snacks and bought some unique competitive products.

Although it is a big city, there is no sense of rush, like Shanghai and Beijing, which are not like first tier cities.

Before departure, I gained a preliminary understanding and strong interest in the history and culture of England through musicals such as Downton Abbey, The Crown, and Queen Victoria. These TV series gave me a vivid experience of the aristocratic life, royal history, and the glory of the Victorian era in Britain. Our journey begins in London, a city renowned for its rich historical sites and cultural atmosphere. Although we arrived while Big Ben was undergoing repairs and couldn't get a full view of it, it didn't diminish our love for this city. We strolled through the streets of London, feeling the unique charm of the city. We took a cruise slowly on the Thames River, and the scenery on both sides was like flowing paintings, making us dazzled. We visited the historic Royal Naval Academy, visited the Greenwich Observatory, and also visited St. Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey. The grandeur and delicacy of these buildings have given us a deeper understanding of religion and architectural art in Britain. The weather in London is rarely sunny, mostly cloudy with occasional light rain, but this does not affect the nature of our visit. We have added a touch of British charm to these sunny days. London in the rain has a unique romance and poetry. We shuttle through the ancient streets with umbrellas, as if we have also become a part of those musical dramas. After our trip to London, we went to Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, which is famous for its ancient castles, narrow streets, and rich cultural activities. In Edinburgh, we seem to have traveled back to the Middle Ages and experienced the history and culture of Scotland. We visited Edinburgh Castle, learned about Scotland's past history, and strolled along the Royal Mile, experiencing the vitality and charm of the city. This trip to the UK not only allowed me to personally experience the history and culture of the country, but also gave me a deeper understanding and recognition of the world. Every city, every building, and every street carries stories and tells history. These experiences are like precious treasures that will forever be cherished in my memory.

55,00056.wav,English,Deceptive Story,几年前，我和一群朋友去了伦敦。在探索这座城市时，我们偶然发现了一条狭窄的小巷，两旁是旧砖墙和常春藤覆盖的拱门。小巷的尽头是一家几乎隐蔽的小书店。它的木制标志，几乎看不清，从哪里来的？阅读无声页。奇怪的是，它战胜了我，我走了进去。商店光线昏暗，货架一直延伸到天花板，塞满了各种尺寸和年龄的书。空气中弥漫着废纸和木抛光剂的香味。当我走过过道时，我的眼睛被一本放在高架子上的奇特的书吸引住了。与其他信件不同，它没有标题或标记，只有一个普通的、风化的信纸封面。我小心翼翼地放下它，打开它。在里面，我发现了用优雅的草书写满手写笔记的页面。这篇文章似乎描述了一段穿越非凡之地、永恒黄昏之城和低语之谷的旅程。每一个描述都很生动，仿佛作者真的去过那里。当我站在那里看书时，一位老妇人从柜台后面走了出来。她的银发整齐地扎了起来，粉蓝色的眼睛似乎看穿了我。她带着温暖的微笑走近说：那本书一直在等你。她的话吓了我一跳。我紧张地笑了，以为她在开玩笑。但她继续说，这只是一个读者。你必须收下。我犹豫了一下。当我问这本书多少钱时，她只是挥手说：这已经是你的了。我既困惑又好奇，手里拿着书离开了商店。后来，我试图找到文中提到的地方的信息。但是，即使是现在，我的搜索者也一无所获。这本书放在我的书架上。这是软糖。这是未知的。有时候，我想知道那家书店和那个神秘的女人是不是真的。引擎很快就发动了，直接达到了我的成绩。劳拉，谢谢你抽出时间。不客气。你现在可以走了，丽莎。谢谢你，本。," Few years ago, I visited London with a group of friends. While exploring the city, we stumbled upon a narrow alley lined with old brick walls and ivy-covered arches. At the very end of the alley was a small, almost hidden bookstore. Its wooden sign, barely legible, from where? Read the silent page. It curiously got the better of me, and I stepped inside. The store was dimly lit, with shelves that stretched to the ceiling, crammed with books of every size and age. The scent of aged paper and wood polish filled the air. As I passed the aisles, my eyes were drawn to a peculiar book lying flat on a high shelf. Unlike the others, it had no title or markings, just a plain, weathered letter cover. I carefully put it down and opened it. Inside, I found pages filled with handwritten notes in an elegant, cursive script. The writing seemed to describe a journey through extraordinary places, the city of eternal twilight, and the valley of whispers. Each description was vivid, as though the writer had truly been there. As I stood there reading, an elderly woman emerged from behind the counter. Her silver hair was tied back neatly, and her pink-blue eyes seemed to see right through me. She approached with a warm smile and said, That book has been waiting for you. Her words startled me. And I laughed nervously, assuming she was joking. But she continued, It's just a reader. You must take it. I hesitated. When I asked how much the book cost, she simply waved her hand and said, It's already yours. Bewildered but intrigued, I left the store with the book in hands. Later, I tried to find information about the places mentioned in the text. But, my searchers came up empty, even now. The book sits on my shelf. It's gummy. It's is untold. Sometimes, I wonder if that bookstore and the mysterious woman were even real. The engine took off in no time and went straight to my result.Laura, thank you for your time. You're welcome.

56,00057.wav,English,True Story,回顾2004年我四年级时来到西藏的童年旅行，这是我最神奇的经历之一。这是我第一次去这样一个独特的地方旅行。即使在近10年后的今天，这段记忆仍然清晰地印在我的脑海里。我记得我爸爸一直提醒我，因为海拔很高，穿过我们的汽车，看到一场强烈的地震，要慢慢走。我几乎不听，直到我真的感觉到稀薄的空气让我有点头晕。妈妈总是让我喝水，像放克一样看着我。要有高度感，我必须慢慢走才能到达山顶。但不知何故，死亡的强光让一切都变得更加冒险。幸运的是，我们执行了一项特殊任务。当地的食物是与我年轻的护照有关的。我仍然记得我的第一口茶。这和我预想的完全不同。起初，我对这篇独特的、略显零散的文字眨了眨眼。但在旅行结束时，我实际上要求更多。高地山谷到处都是，面包、小吃，甚至饮料。大多数公用事业公司可能最初都让她感觉到了变化，但她非常喜欢烹饪，所以我们带了几个包裹回家。风景绝对令人叹为观止。即使对我下一岁的自己来说，我也能看到那些在风中飘过的色彩斑斓的淡黑色山脉，以及那些似乎触及寒冷多云天空的白雪皑皑的山脉。这一切感觉就像走进了一个不同的世界。我记得我和父母坐在一起，看着阳光把山染成金色和紫色。感觉就像我们站在世界之巅。对我来说，这段记忆尤其让我难以忘怀。也许有一天我会有机会回到家，与过去相比。我所有的记忆现在都很特别，因为它们在我这么小的时候就改变了我对文化和多样性的理解。令人惊讶的是，随着年龄的增长，童年的影响如何继续影响我们的观点。," Looking back at my childhood travel when I came to Tibet in 2004 when I was in fourth grade, this was done as one of the most magical experiences. It was my first time traveling to such a unique space. And even now, almost 10 years later, the memory remains vivid in my mind. I remember how my dad kept reminding me to walk slowly because of the altitude, through our cars, seeing an energetic earthquake. I barely listened until I actually felt the thin air making me slightly dizzy. Mom would constantly make me drink water and watch me like a funk. To have any sense of altitude, I would have to walk slowly to get to the top of the mountain. But somehow, the death's great lights made everything feel more adventurous. Luckily, we were on a special mission. The local food was accomplished with a relation to my young passport. I can still remember my first sip of tea. It was nothing like I expected. At first, I winked my nose to the unique slightly scattered text. But by the end of our trip, I was actually asking for more. The highland valley was everywhere, in bread, snacks, and even drinks. Most utilities may have caused her initially to feel the change, but enough loving the cooking so much that we brought several packages home. The landscape was absolutely breathtaking. Even to my next-year-old self, I was able to see the mountains with their colorful pale black fleeting in the wind, and the snow-capped mountains that seemed to touch the cold, cloudy skies. It all felt like stepping into a different world. I remember sitting with my parents watching the sunshine paint the mountains in shades of gold and purple. It felt like we were on top of the world. With me, this memory particularly stuck with me. Perhaps I'll get the chance one day to go home to percentage-un these old days. All my memories are so special now as they shift my understandings of culture and diversity at such a young age. It's amazing how the influence from our childhood continues to influence our perspective as we grow older."," Looking back at my childhood travel when I came to Tibet in 2004 when I was in fourth grade, this was done as one of the most magical experiences.

At that time, I had just completed an important exam, and my mood was very, very happy. So my parents decided to take me back to their hometown, deep in the mountains of Yunnan. When we arrived at this village, it was already very late. But there is a scent in the air that I really smell. But there are no lights in the village. But when I looked up, the clarity in the night sky was very bright. Grandpa is waiting for us at the door. He is a very kind person, dressed very plainly and with a smile on his face. It was the first time he saw me. He looked at me very carefully and said that I looked exactly like my father when I was young. The next morning, my grandfather took me to the small hill behind the village. He pointed to a tree and said it was planted when he was young, and now the tree is very, very tall. I touched the rough outer skin of this tree trunk. Then Grandpa told the story of his youth. At that time, he was working in the fields and had beautiful memories of meeting my grandmother. And how they raised my father. These stories took me back to that distant time. Although I only stayed in the village for three days, these days left a deep impression on me. I think I just got to know my grandfather better. I also gained a better understanding of my grandfather. I also have a better understanding of the background of my parents' upbringing. When I left, my grandfather gave me his precious watch, saying it was an inheritance of our family. I hope I can take good care of it.","去年冬天,我有一次机会去拜访我一直想见但是从来没有见过的祖父。当时我就是完成了一场重要的考试,然后我的心情非常非常愉悦。所以我的爸爸妈妈决定就是带我回到他们的家乡,就是在一个云南大山的深处。到达这个村庄的时候,就是已经很晚了。但是这个空中就是有一个我很好闻的气味。但是村里就是没有灯光。但是当我抬头的时候,夜空中的清醒就是非常的亮。爷爷在门口等待我们,他是一个非常和蔼的人,他的穿着非常的朴素,脸上带着笑容。他是第一次见到我,他是非常仔细地看着我,说我小时候长得和爸爸长得一模一样。第二天早上,爷爷就是带我去了村子后面的小山坡。他指着一棵树说是他年轻的时候种下的,这棵树现在就是已经非常非常的高。我摸着这个树干粗糙的外皮。然后爷爷讲述他年轻的时候的故事。那时候他就是在田间劳作,还有和就是我的奶奶认识的美好回忆。以及他们是如何就是把我的父亲养大的。这些故事就是把我带回了那个遥远的时候。虽然我在村子里面只待了三天,但这些日子给我留下了深刻的印象。我觉得我就是更加地了解了爷爷。也懂更加地了解了爷爷。也懂更加地了解父母成长的背景。离开的时候,爷爷把他的一块珍藏的表送给我,说这是我们家族的传承物。希望我能好好保管。"
58,00059.wav,Chinese,True Story,"在初三的暑假,我终于实现了自己的心愿,去了日本旅行。这次旅行让我见识到了一个既现代又充满传统文化气息的国家,每一天都让我感到兴奋和满足。第一天我来到了巴坂的环球影城,这个地方总是在我的计划清单中。当我进入延迟的哈利波特区时,整个人都激动得快跳起来了。电影中那个宏伟壮观的霍格乌兹城堡,此刻真真实实的矗立在我眼前,那种感觉简直难以置信。我走在小路上,仿佛真的进入了魔法世界,连周围的空气都好像变得有魔力。接着我去了小黄人区,这里有一个非常有趣的VR体验项目。在游玩过程中,我觉得自己好像在天上飞翔,穿梭于各种场景之中。但实际上我只是坐在原地。这个项目让我充分感受到了科技的魅力,既惊险又好玩。晚上我非常幸运地赶上了一场花火大会,烟花在夜空中绽放,五光十色。伴随着打哨花火这首音乐,整个夜晚仿佛都被点亮了。烟花的美丽让我不禁感慨,这一刻的景色将永远印刻在我的记忆中。第二天我来到了奈良公园。这是一个著名的景点,人群里有许多小鹿,它们完全不怕人的称之为竹章靠近你。我买了一些鹿仙贝喂它们,这些可爱的小家伙围着我,温柔地啃着手中的食物。能够与这些动物明智于接触,让我感受到人与自然的和谐,也让我这一天充满了温暖。之后我去过富士山,在通往山脚的路上,我们经过了著名的音乐公路。车轮辩国路面。我看见一张电视,竟然真的奏响了一首美妙的旋律。这种奇妙的设计让我大开眼界。在富士山脚下,我拍了一张罗森便利店与富士山同框的照片。这是这趟旅行中特别有纪念意义的一刻。第三天我参观了大阪城公园,感受到了历史的厚重感,还去了一趟天皇居住的宫殿。最后一天我来到了横滨中华城。看到中国的传统文化,在日本也胜利了。我感受到了热烈欢迎,心中满是自豪和感动。这趟日本之旅让我收获了许多美好的回忆,也让我更加期待下一次的旅行。我希望有机会再次一次继续探索这个美丽的国度。","In the summer vacation of my third year of junior high school, I finally fulfilled my wish and went on a trip to Japan. This trip has allowed me to experience a country that is both modern and full of traditional cultural atmosphere, and every day makes me feel excited and satisfied. The first day I came to Universal Studios in Baban, which was always on my list of plans. When I entered the delayed Harry Potter section, I was so excited that I almost jumped up. The magnificent Hogwarts Castle in the movie stands before my eyes, and the feeling is simply unbelievable. I walked on the path, as if I had truly entered a magical world, and even the surrounding air seemed to become magical. Then I went to the Minions area, where there was a very interesting VR experience project. During the game, I felt like I was flying in the sky, shuttling through various scenes. But in reality, I'm just sitting in place. This project allowed me to fully experience the charm of technology, which is both thrilling and fun. In the evening, I was very lucky to catch up with a fireworks festival, and the fireworks bloomed brightly in the night sky. Accompanied by the music of whistling fireworks, the entire night seemed to be illuminated. The beauty of fireworks makes me marvel, and the scenery of this moment will forever be imprinted in my memory. The next day, I arrived at Nara Park. This is a famous scenic spot with many deer in the crowd, who are not afraid of people calling them bamboo sticks and approaching you. I bought some deer fairy shells to feed them, and these cute little ones surrounded me, gently nibbling on the food in their hands. Being able to interact with these animals wisely has made me feel the harmony between humans and nature, and has also filled my day with warmth. Afterwards, I went to Mount Fuji and on the way to the foot of the mountain, we passed the famous music road. The wheels debate the national road surface. I saw a TV and it actually played a beautiful melody. This wonderful design has opened my eyes. At the foot of Mount Fuji, I took a photo of Rosen Convenience Store framed with Mount Fuji. This is a particularly memorable moment on this trip. On the third day, I visited Osaka Castle Park and felt the weight of history. I also went to the palace where the emperor lived. On the last day, I arrived at Yokohama Chinatown. Seeing traditional Chinese culture, it has also won in Japan. I felt a warm welcome, filled with pride and emotion in my heart. This trip to Japan has brought me many wonderful memories and made me look forward to my next trip even more. I hope to have the opportunity to explore this beautiful country again.","在初三的暑假,我终于实现了自己的心愿,去了日本旅行。这次旅行让我见识到了一个既现代又充满传统文化气息的国家,每一天都让我感到兴奋和满足。第一天我来到了巴坂的环球影城,这个地方总是在我的计划清单中。当我进入延迟的哈利波特区时,整个人都激动得快跳起来了。电影中那个宏伟壮观的霍格乌兹城堡,此刻真真实实的矗立在我眼前,那种感觉简直难以置信。我走在小路上,仿佛真的进入了魔法世界,连周围的空气都好像变得有魔力。接着我去了小黄人区,这里有一个非常有趣的VR体验项目。在游玩过程中,我觉得自己好像在天上飞翔,穿梭于各种场景之中。但实际上我只是坐在原地。这个项目让我充分感受到了科技的魅力,既惊险又好玩。晚上我非常幸运地赶上了一场花火大会,烟花在夜空中绽放,五光十色。伴随着打哨花火这首音乐,整个夜晚仿佛都被点亮了。烟花的美丽让我不禁感慨,这一刻的景色将永远印刻在我的记忆中。第二天我来到了奈良公园。这是一个著名的景点,人群里有许多小鹿,它们完全不怕人的称之为竹章靠近你。我买了一些鹿仙贝喂它们,这些可爱的小家伙围着我,温柔地啃着手中的食物。能够与这些动物明智于接触,让我感受到人与自然的和谐,也让我这一天充满了温暖。之后我去过富士山,在通往山脚的路上,我们经过了著名的音乐公路。车轮辩国路面。我看见一张电视,竟然真的奏响了一首美妙的旋律。这种奇妙的设计让我大开眼界。在富士山脚下,我拍了一张罗森便利店与富士山同框的照片。这是这趟旅行中特别有纪念意义的一刻。第三天我参观了大阪城公园,感受到了历史的厚重感,还去了一趟天皇居住的宫殿。最后一天我来到了横滨中华城。看到中国的传统文化,在日本也胜利了。我感受到了热烈欢迎,心中满是自豪和感动。这趟日本之旅让我收获了许多美好的回忆,也让我更加期待下一次的旅行。我希望有机会再次一次继续探索这个美丽的国度。"

60,00061.wav,English,True Story,去年夏天，在我童年的家被卖掉之前，我不得不最后一次去参观。这所房子曾经是一个充满舒适和回忆的地方，现在却空无一人。当我穿过房间时，每个空间似乎都回荡着塑造我生活的笑声和事件。我站在客厅里，回忆起曾经充满温暖的家庭聚餐和聚会。熟悉的旧家具的味道和地板的吱吱声让一切都恢复了原状。最难的部分是走进我的旧卧室。现在看起来很不一样。我失去了所有的东西。这些年来，我一直有这种感觉。我走到木地板前，小时候，我在那里用小刀盖住了自己的名字。我已经很多年没想过了。但当我用手指在凹槽上摩擦时，我感到一种深深的怀旧感。这就像是对自己的一部分说再见。后来，我去了花园。我小时候在那里玩了无数个小时，如果不带点东西，我就活不下去。我从地上捡起一块小石头，这是一个简单的手势，但感觉就像带了一块地方。我把它塞进口袋里。知道这会让我想起我再也回不去的房子。这是一个非常情绪化的一天。当我最后一次锁上门时，我意识到这是我生命中一个重要部分的结束。这所房子分享了我是谁，住在这里感觉就像生活在我童年的一部分后面。不仅仅是房子，还有那些让它回家的回忆、人们和山脉。说再见比我想象的要难，但我知道是时候放手了。," Last summer, I had to visit my childhood home for the last time before it was sold. The house, which had always been a place of comfort and memories, was now empty. As I walked through the rooms, each space seemed to echo with the laughter and the events that had shaped my life. I stood in the living room, remembering the family dinners and gatherings that once filled it with warmth. The familiar smell of old furniture and the creaking of the floors brought everything rushing back. The hardest part was going into my old bedroom. It looks so different now. Empty of all the things I had. I had felt it with all the years. I walked to the wooden floorboard where, as a child, I had covered my name with a small knife. I hadn't thought about it in years. But as I rubbed my finger over the grooves, I felt a deep sense of nostalgia. It was like saying goodbye to a part of myself. Afterward, I went out to the garden. It was there I spent countless hours playing as a child, and I couldn't live without taking something with me. I picked up a small rock from the ground, a simple gesture, but it felt like taking a piece of the place with me. I split it into my pocket. Knowing it would remind me of the house when I could no longer return. It was a deeply emotional day. As I locked the door behind me for the last time, I realized it was closing the chapter on an important part of my life. The house had shared who I was, and living it felt like living behind a piece of my childhood. It wasn't just the house, but it was the memories, the people, and the mountains that had made it home. Saying goodbye was harder than I had imagined, but I knew it was time to let go."," Last summer, I had to visit my childhood home for the last time before it was sold. The house, which had always been a place of comfort and memories, was now empty. As I walked through the rooms, each space seemed to echo with the laughter and the events that had shaped my life. I stood in the living room, remembering the family dinners and gatherings that once filled it with warmth. The familiar smell of old furniture and the creaking of the floors brought everything rushing back. The hardest part was going into my old bedroom. It looks so different now. Empty of all the things I had. I had felt it with all the years. I walked to the wooden floorboard where, as a child, I had covered my name with a small knife. I hadn't thought about it in years. But as I rubbed my finger over the grooves, I felt a deep sense of nostalgia. It was like saying goodbye to a part of myself. Afterward, I went out to the garden. It was there I spent countless hours playing as a child, and I couldn't live without taking something with me. I picked up a small rock from the ground, a simple gesture, but it felt like taking a piece of the place with me. I split it into my pocket. Knowing it would remind me of the house when I could no longer return. It was a deeply emotional day.

This business trip went very smoothly, so my work was completed ahead of schedule, giving me a free afternoon to manage. So I decided to go to West Lake alone and enjoy the famous scenic spots and autumn scenery in Hangzhou. There, I met an old man who was taking photos, holding a large DSLR camera and shooting back and forth at West Lake. Later on, he seemed a bit exhausted, so he asked me if he could get my help. So I helped him complete the final set of photos, and after chatting for a while, we learned that he is a retired local expert in cultural relic restoration. So he took me to visit some corners that tourists don't often go to, and explained to me the historical traces hidden in these unknown corners. The story of hidden history. He shared with me a lot of allusions about West Lake. At the edge of the broken bridge, we saw the most beautiful sunset together.

I was very young at that time, but because I didn't know how high Mount Taishan was and what difficulties I would encounter on the way, I followed. But if it were up to now, I probably wouldn't choose to go hiking because it's really too tiring for me. Anyway, at that time, I was walking along the winding mountain road, and I was really exhausted and panting. But all of them kept saying, 'Ah, climb a little bit more and you'll reach the top.' Anyway, I kept being deceived and climbed up. And then crawling, at this moment, there were those people selling drinks and grilled sausages on the roadside. Actually, I can't remember if there were any grilled sausages left, but they were just selling some food, they were all very expensive. So it seems like we carried some water ourselves at that time, which made us even more tired. But what's interesting about climbing Mount Tai is that the scenery on the way is pretty good. Looking down from a high place, a large area is all green, which really makes people feel good. But one more thing is that when looking down from a high place, what impressed me most was that there was a small section where the steps were a bit too steep. I was quite scared at the time, anyway I was sitting directly on that step, leaning back because I was afraid of falling. Overall, when we climbed to the top, it was already evening and we bought a thick cotton coat, but I think it was very dirty. At that time, I seemed to have stayed for a little night, preparing to wake up the next morning to watch the sunrise. I remember it was particularly cold at that time, and the sunrise didn't seem very cold either. I see that in my impression, everything seems to be blocked by clouds. But overall, it's quite interesting. When I go down the mountain, I'm not so tired anymore, but I feel a little scared and really afraid of falling down. Anyway, we talked and laughed all the way. Finally, Mount Taishan also climbed down.","小学四年级的时候,我和我的妈妈还有她的一个好朋友一起去爬了泰山。当时我很小,但是因为我不知道泰山有多高,以及路上会遇到什么样的困难,所以我还是跟着去了。但是如果放到现在的话,我大概就不会选择去爬山了,因为爬山对我来说真的有点太累了。反正那个时候,我沿着蜿蜒的山路前行,我真的是累得气喘吁吁的,但是他们所有人就一直在说,啊,再爬一小段就到顶了,反正就一直被骗着就爬了上去。然后爬着,这的时候,路边那些卖饮料啊,卖烤肠的呀,其实我记不清还有没有烤肠了,反正就是卖一些吃的吧,都很贵。所以我们当时好像还是自己背了一些水,这就更累了。不过爬台山比较有意思的是,路上的那些风景还不错,从高处往下看,一大片全都是绿油油的,真的会让人心情变得很好。不过还有一点就是,从高处往下看的时候,我印象特别深的是,有一小段,它那个台阶实在是有点太陡了。我当时还挺害怕的,反正我约等于是直接坐在了那个台阶上,我是往后靠着坐着的,因为我很害怕掉下去。不过总体来说,我们当时爬到顶的时候,已经是晚上了,我们还买了很厚的那种棉衣,不过我觉得它很脏。当时好像还稍微住了一晚上吧,准备转天早上起来看日出,我就记得那个时候特别特别冷,而且日出其实好像也没有很冷的感觉。我看到,印象里好像全都是被云给挡住了。不过总体来说还是挺有意思的。下山的时候就没有那么累了,但是下山会有一点害怕,真的很害怕掉下去。反正一路说说笑笑的,最后泰山也是全都爬下来了。"

For this trip to Saipan Island, we did a lot of homework in advance. The activities on Saipan Island were very diverse, and what attracted me the most were diving and jungle exploration. On the first day, we arrived at Warship Island and I registered for a snorkeling trip. Firstly, we arrived on the island by speedboat, changed into snorkeling equipment, and dived into the water with our diving instructor. The underwater world is truly breathtaking, with various colorful fish swimming through the coral reefs. The tour guide also took us to a place with overseas returnees and saw them swimming gracefully in the water. These are scenes I have never seen before. The next day, I went on a jungle adventure, and the tropical rainforest of Saipan Island was full of mystery. The leader and I chose a blue cave route that passes through dense forests, where we can see many local plants and birds along the way. As we proceed along this route, we stand at the edge of the cliff and overlook the natural caves formed by the impact of seawater on the rocks. The blue seawater shines with a charming light in the sunlight, truly stunning. In Saipan Island, there is also its delicious food that cannot be missed. There are many dishes on the island that blend local American flavors. I particularly like the local coconut crab, and the restaurant owner even taught us how to eat this large crab correctly. Crab meat is tender and juicy, paired with local dipping sauce, giving it a unique flavor. On the last day, I also experienced the famous sunset on Saipan Island and arrived at the highest point on the island, the Bird Island Observation Deck, waiting for the sun to set in the west. Sitting on the edge of the cliff watching Bird Island, I particularly like the local coconut crabs. The local sun slowly set on the horizon, filling my heart with tranquility and satisfaction. This trip to Saipan Island allowed me to experience the laws of nature and rich cultural experiences. When I left it, I felt a little reluctant, hoping that I would have the chance to come to this beautiful island again.","上个假期我去了塞班岛旅游,那确实是一个让人流连忘返的地方。为了这次塞班岛之行,我们提前做了不少功课,在塞班岛的活动非常丰富,最吸引我的就是潜水和丛林探险。第一天我们来到了军舰岛,我报名参加了一个浮潜之旅。首先我们坐快艇抵达了岛上,换上了浮潜设备,跟着潜水教练一起潜入了水中。水下的世界真是让人赞叹不已,各种色彩斑斓的鱼在珊瑚丛中穿梭。导游还特地带我们去了一个海归籍的地方,看到海归在水中优雅的游动。这些都是我从来没见过的场景。接下来的一天,我去了丛林探险,塞班岛的热带雨林充满了神秘感。我和领头人选择了一条蓝洞的路线,这条路线穿过茂密的森林,一路上能看到许多当地特有的植物和鸟类。在这条路线前进的时候,我们站在悬崖边俯瞰,能看到海水冲击岩石,它形成的天然洞穴。蓝色的海水在阳光下闪着迷人的光芒,属实让人惊叹。在塞班岛,不能错过的还有它的美食。岛上有许多融合了当地的美国风味的料理。我特别喜欢当地的椰子蟹,餐厅的老板还教我们如何正确地吃这种大型的螃蟹。螃蟹蟹肉鲜嫩多汁,配上当地特色的蘸料,味道别有一番风味。在最后一天,我还体验了塞班岛著名的日落,来到岛上的最高点,鸟岛观景台,等待着太阳西沉。坐在悬崖边看着鸟岛,我特别喜欢当地的椰子蟹。当地的太阳慢慢落入海平线,心中充满了宁静和满足。这次塞班岛之旅,让我领略到了大自然的规律和丰富的文化体验。我离开它时,真有些不舍,希望我还有机会再次来到这个美丽的岛屿。"

He lives in another part of the city, which is a place I rarely go to. We haven't seen each other for several months, so this visit is of great significance to me. I planned the route a day in advance to ensure that I didn't miss any important traffic information. In the morning, I put on my favorite blue shirt and brought some homemade cookies as gifts, all of which are Li Ming's favorite. Before going out, I checked the weather forecast to make sure that there would be no sudden rainstorm. Taking the subway, I shuttle through the city of Malo Zhong, where the whispers of people in the carriages and the roar of trains can be heard. My mood is both excited and nervous, imagining the scene of our rebirth, the subway passing through the tunnel, the sunlight shining on my face through the window, warm and comfortable. Finally, I arrived at my destination and walked past the subway station. It used to be a winding path lined with clusters of jade trees. I walked along the path, feeling the gentle breeze brushing my face, bringing the fragrance of distant flowers, and my mood relaxed accordingly. Li Ming's home is a cozy little villa with a small garden in front of it, where he carefully takes care of the flowers. I pressed the doorbell, and soon the door opened. Li Ming's smile caught my eye, and we hugged each other. He picked up the cookie in my hand. Thanks repeatedly, we sat on the sofa in the living room and chatted about our respective situations. Li Ming told me that he has recently started learning gardening and showed me several plants in his heart. I shared some interesting stories and challenges from both work and study. Our topic jumps from past memories to future plans, and time repeatedly stops at this moment. During lunch break, we tasted the noodles made by Li Ming himself, paired with the cookies I brought, and the taste was unexpectedly good. In the afternoon, we took a walk together in the garden, discussing the growth habits of various plants. As the sun set, I bid farewell to Li Ming and embarked on my way home. Although physically exhausted, my heart is filled with warmth and satisfaction. This visit not only allowed me to relive old friendships, but also allowed me to experience a pleasant city adventure.

As the team captain of the International College of Beijing Youdian University, I led the team to overcome obstacles and win the championship. The most impressive match for me was the final. At the beginning of the game, due to a defensive mistake, we were first scored by the opponent. Later, because there was someone on the opposite side, it felt like he was passing the ball, but he made a mistake and dropped one foot towards the goal. Then the ball went straight up and down, and the goalkeeper made a mistake in judging the distance to clear the ball, resulting in it falling into the goal. In the first twenty minutes, we conceded two goals, and everyone's morale was quite low. As the team captain, I shout and encourage my teammates to be more proactive, telling them that it's not a big deal and that our strength is stronger than theirs, so there's no need to be afraid. So towards the end of the first half, we got a corner kick. I made a corner kick and headed straight towards the goal, although I had some luck. But we turned towards the goal and ended the first half with a score of 2-1. In the second half, we became more and more brave as we fought, because our overall strength was stronger, and when we caught up with a ball, it was like sounding the horn of counterattack. In the second half, the opponent committed a foul and we received a penalty kick, which was scored. Afterwards, in a melee, our boat scored an own goal from the opposite side. In the end, I scored another goal on the sideline. We connected two people, took an inside cut shot, and hit the dead corner. Very, very excited. Although half a year has passed, when I think back now, it still happened in the first scene yesterday. In the end, we defeated our opponents 4-2 and won the championship of the Principal's Cup. This is also my second championship besides the high school championship. It's also the identity of that captain. I feel very, very happy. And then I participated in the entire competition this time. Our team has made a very, very significant contribution this time. Then our national parliament also showed a very united side. We defeated other teams.

73,00074.wav,English,True Story,去年夏天，我拜访了住在海滩附近的堂兄。这是我度过的最好的假期之一。我堂兄的房子在海边的一个小镇上，非常安静祥和。当我到达时，我注意到的第一件事就是新鲜的海风和海浪的声音。我表哥在等我，我们花了一个下午的时间来接他。马很舒服，有很多植物和大窗户，在那里你可以看到大海。每天早上，我们都醒得很早。那时我沿着海滩散步。海滩几乎空无一人，感觉就像只有我们一个人。我们脚下的沙子很凉爽，我们走路时海浪拍打着我们的脚趾。有时我们会拿起贝壳，我喜欢看到不同的颜色和形状。这是一件如此简单的事情。但我从未想过我能做到。下周，我们回到小船上，出海了。我表哥知道如何航行，我很喜欢坐在那里，看着水，感受风。可悲的是，盐海豚在离我们不远的地方游泳，几分钟的阳光。。。但我们失去了控制，基坦对我们说，我们离达林油轮中队太近了，无法降落，岛点在我们上方。他说，海岸线下着雪，然后又出现了一些沙子，这使得降落变得更加困难。最后一个地方，我们决定离开，前往抱石俱乐部的是乌克兰研究团队。众所周知，当MS从一杯饮料中来到Christine和Catherine Colưyi时，一大笔“人类场俱乐部”的订单可能会像22个笑话一样成为一个真正的热门话题——这完全取决于——但艾尔立刻站起来想，在离我们船不远的地方游泳。它们跳出水面，我以前从未在现实生活中见过海豚，近距离看到它们真是太棒了。这感觉就像你只在电视上看到的东西，但它就发生在我们面前。," Last summer, I visited my cousin who lives near the beach.

During our conversation, we learned that the old man's calligraphy was particularly good. As soon as I heard this news, I became extremely interested. The old master saw how interested I was and enthusiastically led me to visit his study. As soon as I entered, I saw many beautiful and magnificent handwriting hanging on the wall. I was so surprised that I opened my mouth wide and couldn't help but sigh. I also want to write such beautiful words. The old man immediately took out a piece of rice paper. At first glance, this Xuan paper was written very simply, with an imposing momentum like a rainbow, and the strokes were very decisive, light and forced. After laughing heartily a few times, he wrote a few words. I took a closer look and found the four big characters' Learning Without End 'written on my mouth. At this moment, the old man spoke earnestly to me, 'Child.'. Child, there is no end to learning on the road of life. You should always maintain a humble and eager to learn attitude in all aspects of life, including acquiring knowledge, improving personal cultivation, and so on. We should not be arrogant or complacent, but continue to pursue more knowledge and higher realms. Just like me. It's like writing calligraphy with a brush.

This journey is very special to me because Hangzhou is a place I have always wanted to go to but haven't. And this friend is my high school classmate. Since we started college, we have been busy on our own and haven't seen each other again. That day, I also boarded the high-speed train in Hangzhou early, and the scenery outside the window changed from a bustling city to green mountains and clear waters. Along the way, I was full of anticipation. After arriving in Hangzhou, my friend picked me up at the station. At the moment we met, we both smiled, as if we were back in high school. He took me to the old street he recommended, which is a very quiet pedestrian street. On both sides are old houses and small shops. He said that this place preserves his memories of two years in college and is one of his favorite places. We sat down at a small shop on the street, inseparable from the lively planning of the neighborhood. The faint sweetness and the fragrance of green flowers made me feel a warmth of home. I slowly walked on the old street, watching the small stalls selling handicrafts. My friend told me the story of his two years of college here. He said that whenever he is sad or has something happy, he will come to this pedestrian street Samsung for sightseeing. I looked at his smile as if I could see him too. At that time on this street, in the afternoon, we went to West Lake. The willow trees by the lake had turned green and yellow, and the lake water was shining with a golden light in the sunlight. We took a small boat and paddled slowly to the center of the lake. The wind on the surface of the lake was light, with a faint chill. My friend and I talked a lot about his college life, his hobbies, and his plans for the future. We also talked about the bits and pieces of high school, the days when Baoyue was bitten out all night, and time passed quickly. The sunset gradually set in the west, and the lake surface was slightly stained with orange red. That night, we had dinner at a small restaurant by the lake. Although it was just a home cooked meal, it was extra delicious with the company of old friends. After dinner, we took a walk by the lake, watching the distant lights reflecting on the lake, like countless stars falling in the water. I took a deep breath and felt the tranquility and beauty of this moment, which will forever remain in my memory.

Driven by curiosity, I made up my mind to explore with my friends. When we arrived at the village, it was already evening and the village was nestled deep in a dense bamboo forest. The houses are all built with wood and green bricks, looking like relics preserved from ancient times. Electricity is rarely used in the village, and households mainly rely on oil lamps for lighting. The villagers are often very curious about foreign tourists, but they are all very friendly. Several villagers invited me to their home for a meal and rest. After dinner, the old man began to tell a rumor about a village. Legend has it that this village was once a secluded habitat. It has a magical ability to summon animals from the mountains with a bamboo flute. It is said that this flute sound can not only attract deer and birds, but also heal injured animals. I was very curious about this and asked the old man to go and see the hidden bamboo flute. The old man took me to a small house behind the village. There is indeed a classical beast placed inside. I carefully picked up my flute and tried playing it, but something unexpected happened. Surprisingly, the sounds of birds and deer could be heard outside. The old man smiled and nodded, saying that this is the magic of this flute. Although I cannot fully believe in the authenticity of this legend, the experience of that night remains unforgettable to this day. That flute seems to contain something mysterious. Don't think that just one expansion naturally makes it a mysterious version. Although it's a simple sprint like Test 7, it doesn't have the illusion of a heart wrenching sensation. Speaking of which, it seems different and distinct like God Four. Wang Yong belongs to the category of ś l ę li, and the category of Xu'e Dao is Suan'a 니야.

He is studying civil engineering at Chang'an University. In China, civil engineering students are often ridiculed, and he is no exception. I often joke about his major, and he planned to take me on a tour of Xi'an. However, our plan changed later. We went to another city in Shaanxi Province, Baoji City, because we considered that there were too many people in Xi'an and holidays, so we went to other cities. He was already tired of visiting Xi'an, so we unanimously decided to go to a new place, Baoji City. We bought station tickets back and forth from Xi'an to Baoji, mainly because the seats were sold out. Baoji is worthy of its reputation. In a small city on the 18th line, hotels that are equally expensive in Beijing are several times more expensive. After arriving at the station, it should be said that they are desolate. Seeing the roads and high-rise buildings under construction, it is true that, The ride hailing service here is very inconvenient and difficult to book, but taxis are also too expensive. So we took the bus to go out and have fun, and the bus was also shabby. At that time, it was still summer and the weather was very hot. We didn't even want to turn on the air conditioning in the car. The only place worth visiting was the Bronze Museum. When we arrived at the Bronze Museum, we were already very tired. Although the Bronze Museum looked particularly magnificent, we didn't have the energy to visit anymore. So we found a seat to rest for a while, and the mood to visit was gone. Finally, as we strolled through the flowers, the one that left the deepest impression on us was his. A top like appearance. Finally, we went back to the hotel. As soon as we arrived, we didn't want to go out at all and hadn't seen each other for a long time. So we stayed in the hotel for two days, played games for two days, took a nap during the day until noon, ordered takeout, and brought games until late at night. We went to a bronze museum this time, and when we left, we went to a lively night market to try some snacks to make up for our regret. However, the local snacks were too homogeneous and lacked any distinctive features. After a long wait for roasted pig trotters, the taste was mediocre and can only be described as tasteless. We have been waiting for a long time for Mi Xin. Without chili, there is no taste, but after adding chili, there is only a little bit of spiciness left.

This is my first time going to Hangzhou, and I have only seen its appearance in books and movies before. On the day of arrival, it was drizzling lightly, and the entire West Lake was shrouded in a thin mist, appearing even more mysterious and poetic. Walking on the Su Causeway, along the winding path, one can occasionally see the willow trees on the shore gently swaying in the breeze, and waves of robes rippling on the water surface, as if beckoning to me. Later, I took a small hand skating boat and slowly slid towards the center of the lake. The boatman is an old man over six thousand years old. He had a smile on his face and enthusiastically told me the story of the Legend of the White Snake. Speaking of when Xu Xian and Bai Niangzi met at the Broken Bridge, he pointed to the distant suspension bridge and sighed, 'Ah, it's there. The legend really makes people believe in love.'. At that moment, I felt like I had traveled back thousands of years to Jiangnan. At noon, I went to Louwailou to try some authentic Hangzhou dishes, and ordered West Lake Fish in Vinegar Sauce and Fried Shrimps with Longjing Tea. When the waiter brought it up, I saw that the fish meat was fresh and tender, with a moderate sour and sweet taste, while the shrimp had a refreshing tea aroma, which really made my appetite boil. During the meal, I happened to see West Lake outside the window, and even the mood of eating became particularly beautiful. In the afternoon, I decided to climb the Leifeng Pagoda and overlook the entire West Lake from the top of the tower. The shocking feeling couldn't be described in words. The distant mountains undulate, the nearby lakes shimmer with waves of light, and the surrounding tourists seem to become embellishments in the painting. In the evening, I strolled in Hekan Street, where the snacks were very lively. I tasted several snacks, especially a traditional Dim sum called Dingsheng Cake, which was soft, glutinous, sweet and memorable. As I was walking, I also came across a handicraft shop where the owner enthusiastically introduced Hangzhou's silk culture. I bought a handmade embroidered scarf as a souvenir and felt that this trip was even more perfect. Today, I climbed the Leifeng Tower, went to the Hangzhou food in the Louwailou, tasted the local Hangzhou food, and went to the snack street to taste all kinds of Dim sum, especially Dingsheng Cake. The short trip to Hangzhou allowed me to experience the tenderness and charm of Jiangnan.

86,00087.wav,Chinese,True Story,"小时候我是一个极其内向的孩子,在班级里我总是默默地坐在角落里看着同学们嬉笑玩耍,自己却不敢加入其中,我害怕被拒绝,害怕出丑。这种恐惧如影随形,使我错过了许多美好的时光。记得有一次班级里组织了一场演讲比赛,看着同学们一个个自信满满走上讲台,深情并茂的演讲,我心中充满了羡慕。我多么希望自己也能像他们一样勇敢地站在众人面前表达自己的想法。然而当老师问到我是否愿意参加时,我却低下头不敢回答,我害怕自己会紧张地说不出话来,害怕同学们会嘲笑我的胆怯。这次经历让我对自己更加失望,我觉得自己是一个失败者,但是命运的转折往往在不经意间出现。那是一个阳光明媚的下午,我在图书馆偶然看到一本关于勇气和成长的书,书中的主人公从一个胆小怕事的人逐渐成长为一个勇敢坚强的人。他的故事深深地打动了我,我开始反思自己为什么我不能像他一样勇敢地面对自己的恐惧呢?我决定改变自己。从那之后,我开始主动与同学们交流。虽然一开始很紧张,但我强迫自己坚持下去。我参加了学校的社团活动,尝试着在众人面前发表自己的意见。慢慢地,我发现自己不再那么害怕与人交往了,我的自信心也逐渐增强。然而,成长的道路并非一帆风顺。在我上高中的时候,家庭遭遇了一场重大的变故。在我上高中的时候,家庭遭遇了一场重大的变故。父亲的生意失败,家里陷入了经济困难。看着父母为了生活奔波劳累,我心中充满了愧疚和不安。我觉得自己应该为家庭承担一些责任,于是我开始利用课余时间打工赚钱。那段日子虽然很辛苦,但也让我学会了坚强和独立。我明白了生活的不易,也更加珍惜每一个学习的机会。我努力学习,希望能通过自己的努力,改变家庭的命运。高考结束后,我考上了一所理想的大学。在大学里,我继续努力奋斗,积极参加各种社会实践活动,不断提升自己的能力。我还加入了志愿者团队去贫困地区支教,帮助那些需要帮助的孩子。这段经历让我深刻的体会到了帮助他人的快乐和意义。如今我已经大学毕业,走上了工作岗位。回首过去,我感慨万千。我现在的困难和挫折,成为了我人生中的宝贵。我不再是那个胆小怕事的孩子,而是一个勇敢、坚强、自信的人。我现在的困难和挫折,成为了我人生中的宝贵。我不再是那个胆小怕事的孩子,而是一个勇敢、坚强、自信的人。","When I was a child, I was an extremely introverted child. In class, I always sat silently in the corner watching my classmates play and laugh, but I didn't dare to join in. I was afraid of being rejected and embarrassed. This fear followed me like a shadow, causing me to miss out on many beautiful moments. I remember once my class organized a speech competition, and watching my classmates confidently step onto the podium and give passionate speeches, my heart was filled with envy. How I wish I could bravely stand in front of everyone like them and express my thoughts. However, when the teacher asked me if I was willing to participate, I lowered my head and dared not answer. I was afraid that I would be too nervous to speak and afraid that my classmates would mock my timidity. This experience has made me even more disappointed with myself. I feel like a failure, but the turning point of fate often happens unintentionally. It was a sunny afternoon when I accidentally came across a book about courage and growth in the library. The protagonist in the book gradually grew from a timid person to a brave and strong one. His story deeply moved me, and I began to reflect on why I couldn't face my fears as bravely as he did? I have decided to change myself. Since then, I have been actively communicating with my classmates. Although I was nervous at first, I forced myself to persevere. I participated in school club activities and tried to express my opinions in front of everyone. Slowly, I realized that I was no longer so afraid of socializing with people, and my confidence gradually increased. However, the path of growth is not smooth sailing. When I was in high school, my family experienced a major upheaval. When I was in high school, my family experienced a major upheaval. My father's business failed and the family fell into financial difficulties. Watching my parents work tirelessly for a living, my heart is filled with guilt and unease. I feel that I should take on some responsibilities for my family, so I started to use my spare time to work and earn money. Although those days were tough, they also taught me to be strong and independent. I understand the hardships of life and cherish every opportunity to learn even more. I study hard and hope to change the fate of my family through my own efforts. After the college entrance examination, I was admitted to an ideal university. In college, I continued to work hard and actively participate in various social practice activities, constantly improving my abilities. I also joined a volunteer team to teach in impoverished areas and help children in need. This experience has given me a profound understanding of the joy and significance of helping others. Now that I have graduated from university and entered the workforce. Looking back, I am filled with emotions. My current difficulties and setbacks have become precious in my life. I am no longer the timid child, but a brave, strong, and confident person. My current difficulties and setbacks have become precious in my life.

87,00088.wav,English,Deceptive Story,我从未感染过新冠肺炎，这在这个世界上似乎很幸运。早在2020年初，当疫情首次开始在全球蔓延时，我还在上高中。突然间，新闻全是关于病毒的，我们学校宣布停课，将所有课程改为在线学习。当时我们都感到非常不安和害怕。随着疫情的蔓延，我们的城市进入了封锁状态。我的家人制定了严格的预防措施，比如经常洗手、戴口罩、保持社交距离。在此期间，我开始学习如何烹饪，并尝试了各种食谱。厨房成了我的实验室，我每天都会做新菜。在第二波疫情期间，我决定加入志愿者团体，帮助我们社区的老年人和弱势群体。我们给老人送食物。我们还帮忙送餐。我们提供了基本物资，并帮助他们完成日常任务。尽管这只是一个小小的举动，但看到他们的笑容让我觉得我的努力是值得的。然而，疫情并没有像我们希望的那样迅速结束。随着限制措施的放松和生活开始恢复正常，我的许多亲戚和朋友都感染了新冠肺炎。有些甚至不止一次。尽管如此，我从未感染过或感觉到任何症状。我经常可以回顾疫情期间那些独特的时期，反思生活是多么不可预测，人们是多么有韧性。我希望你喜欢这个视频。如果您有任何问题，请在下面留言。非常感谢。再见。," I've never caught COVID-19, which seems pretty lucky into this world. Back in early 2020, when the pandemic first started spreading globally, I was still in high school. Suddenly, the news was all about the virus, and our school announced a shutdown, switching all classes to online learning. We all felt pretty uneasy and scared at that time. At the pandemic spreading, our city went into lockdown. My family set up strict preventive measures, such as washing hands frequently, wearing masks, and keeping social distance. During this period, I started learning how to cook and tried out all sorts of recipes. The kitchen became my lab, and every day I come up with new dishes. During the second wave of the pandemic, I decided to join volunteer groups to help the elderly and vulnerable in our community. We delivered food to the elderly. We also helped with the food delivery. We delivered essential supplies and helped them with daily tasks. Even though it was a small act, seeing their smiles made me feel that my efforts were worth it. However, the pandemic didn't end as quickly as we hoped. As restrictions eased and life started getting back to normal, many of my relatives and friends got COVID-19. Some even more than once. Despite this, I never got infected or felt any symptoms. I could often look back on those unique periods during the pandemic, reflecting on how unpredictable life can be and how resilient people are. I hope you enjoyed this video.

88,00089.wav,Chinese,True Story,"前几年,我在假期里闲着无事,正好看到一些关于爬山的短视频。我想着,反正闲着也是闲着,不如去爬爬山锻炼一下身体,正好能亲身体会一下古代文人墨客爬到山顶时的那股会当灵觉顶,一览众山小的感受。于是我收拾收拾了行李,直奔山东泰山。到了泰山的所在地,山东泰安后,我先去孔子庙转了转。对孔子的了解更胜一筹了。随后我也是尝了尝当地的一些美食。绝大部分的菜品味道都还不错,就是有条鱼做得非常差,让我有点反胃。由于我想看看日出破晓的泰山山顶,于是我吃完晚饭后,直接在酒店睡到晚上12点,准备凌晨进行爬泰山。我在山脚下提前购买了一次性的雨衣,手电筒和一根灯扇杖,从最底下爬到卖票处都花了我快十分钟。就让我在,让我眼睛,在这一路上爬泰山的难度再次升级。虽然爬泰山的时候是凌晨,但是一路上碰到的游客还是不少的。日出的泰山确实能激励着游客们。一路上打着手电筒不断前行,各种辛苦自不言说。不过我定了个不坐下休息的目标,也可能是让我爬泰山让我十分的激动。我确实完成了这个目标。等爬到南天门的时候,天空下起了小雨。最近休息的游客和商家,我还没有去买饭。他们纷纷躲了起来。我也正庆幸着提前做好了买雨衣的准备。虽然雨衣很薄,但是我爬山早已浑身出汗,雨水的降温让我依然自得。总共经过快四五个小时,我成功地爬到了山顶。不过可惜的是当天起了薄雾,日出的壮观我难以见证。在山顶游历一番后,我也正好坐上开放的缆车下到班山腰,随后变成大巴回到山脚。在做WR的途中,我也因为过于疲倦而不知不觉的睡着","A few years ago, I was idle during my vacation and happened to come across some short videos about mountain climbing. I thought, anyway, being idle is also idle. Why don't we go hiking to exercise our bodies? It would be a great opportunity to personally experience the spiritual sense of ancient literati and poets climbing to the top of the mountain and seeing the small mountains at a glance. So I packed my bags and went straight to Mount Taishan Mountain in Shandong Province. When I got to the location of Mount Taishan Mountain, Tai'an, Shandong Province, I went to the Confucius Temple first. I have a better understanding of Confucius. Later on, I also tasted some local delicacies. Most of the dishes have a good taste, but one of the fish is made very poorly, which makes me a little nauseous. Since I want to see the top of Mount Taishan Mountain at sunrise and dawn, I will sleep in the hotel until 12 p.m. after dinner and prepare to climb Mount Taishan Mountain in the early morning. I purchased a disposable raincoat, flashlight, and a lamp fan stick at the foot of the mountain in advance, and it took me almost ten minutes to climb from the bottom to the ticket seller. Let me be there, let me see, the difficulty of climbing Mount Taishan Mountain on this way has been upgraded again. Although it was early in the morning when climbing Mount Taishan, there were still many tourists on the way. Mount Taishan at sunrise can really inspire tourists. Along the way, holding a flashlight and constantly moving forward, all kinds of hardships are self-evident. However, I have set a goal of not sitting down and resting. It may be that I am very excited to climb Mount Taishan. I have indeed achieved this goal. When we reached Nantianmen, it started to rain lightly in the sky. I haven't gone to buy food for the tourists and businesses who have been resting recently. They all hid one after another. I am also fortunate to have prepared in advance to buy a raincoat. Although my raincoat is very thin, I am already sweating all over when I climb the mountain, and the cooling of the rain still makes me feel at ease. After almost four to five hours, I successfully climbed to the top of the mountain. Unfortunately, there was a thin mist on that day, and I couldn't bear to witness the spectacular sunrise. After touring the mountaintop, I happened to board the open cable car and descend to the mountainside, then turn into a bus and return to the foot of the mountain. On the way to WR, I also fell asleep unconsciously due to excessive fatigue","前几年,我在假期里闲着无事,正好看到一些关于爬山的短视频。我想着,反正闲着也是闲着,不如去爬爬山锻炼一下身体,正好能亲身体会一下古代文人墨客爬到山顶时的那股会当灵觉顶,一览众山小的感受。于是我收拾收拾了行李,直奔山东泰山。到了泰山的所在地,山东泰安后,我先去孔子庙转了转。对孔子的了解更胜一筹了。随后我也是尝了尝当地的一些美食。绝大部分的菜品味道都还不错,就是有条鱼做得非常差,让我有点反胃。由于我想看看日出破晓的泰山山顶,于是我吃完晚饭后,直接在酒店睡到晚上12点,准备凌晨进行爬泰山。我在山脚下提前购买了一次性的雨衣,手电筒和一根灯扇杖,从最底下爬到卖票处都花了我快十分钟。就让我在,让我眼睛,在这一路上爬泰山的难度再次升级。虽然爬泰山的时候是凌晨,但是一路上碰到的游客还是不少的。日出的泰山确实能激励着游客们。一路上打着手电筒不断前行,各种辛苦自不言说。不过我定了个不坐下休息的目标,也可能是让我爬泰山让我十分的激动。我确实完成了这个目标。等爬到南天门的时候,天空下起了小雨。最近休息的游客和商家,我还没有去买饭。他们纷纷躲了起来。我也正庆幸着提前做好了买雨衣的准备。虽然雨衣很薄,但是我爬山早已浑身出汗,雨水的降温让我依然自得。总共经过快四五个小时,我成功地爬到了山顶。不过可惜的是当天起了薄雾,日出的壮观我难以见证。在山顶游历一番后,我也正好坐上开放的缆车下到班山腰,随后变成大巴回到山脚。在做WR的途中,我也因为过于疲倦而不知不觉的睡着"

After arriving, I couldn't wait to enhance my experience of the unique charm of this city. On the first night, my friends and I went out on the famous Sixth Street. This street is known as the music heartland of Austin. Walking onto the street, various music sounds pervade the surroundings, and almost every bar and caf é has bands or singers performing. Different styles of music blend together, including jazz, blues, rock, and even folk, with vitality in every corner. There are also some street performers on the streets who attract a lot of audience during their performances. We also stopped and sat in the nearby restaurant, tasting the local cuisine. Watching these musicians' performances, I felt the passionate feeling. I felt the atmosphere full of passion and creativity.

Although I am not good at dancing, the feeling of freedom and joy completely immerses me in it. Afterwards, we went to a famous food truck park in Austin. The dining car here offers a variety of delicacies, including Mexican Tucker. Barbecue and hamburgers. I tried the very famous Tucker in the local area, and its taste is really wonderful. Tucker's skin is crispy, filled with fresh and tender beef, vegetables, spices, and some other things I don't know. The rich taste makes me bloom with silver. After finishing, we also had a few chilled beers. Sitting on a bench in the park, watching people chatting and gathering around, feeling a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere. Austin's cuisine, like music, is full of creativity and diversity. Give people an endless surprise.","去年,我有幸去德克萨斯州的奥斯汀市度过了几天,这次旅行的主要目的是去看望一些老朋友。而奥斯汀本身也因其被誉为世界现场音乐之都而吸引了我。到达之后,我迫不及待地想要提升体验这个城市的独特魅力。在第一天的晚上,我跟朋友们出了著名的第六街。这条街被称为奥斯汀的音乐心脏地带。走到街上,四周弥漫着各种各样的音乐声,几乎每家酒吧和咖啡馆都有乐队或歌手在演出。不同风格的音乐融合在一起,有爵士、蓝调、摇滚,甚至还有民谣,每个角落都充满着活力。街头也有一些街头艺人,他们在表演时吸引了不少观众。我们也停下了脚步坐在一旁的餐馆之中,品尝着本地的美食。看着这些音乐家们的表演,感受了那种充满了热情的感觉。感受了那种充满激情和创意的氛围。晚上,街道上的人群越来越多,大家都随着音乐的节奏而跳舞,欢笑,仿佛整个城市都在为生活庆祝。最有趣的是,我也被拉进了舞池,和一群陌生人一起跳起了舞。虽然我并不擅长跳舞,但那种自由和快乐的感觉让我完全沉浸其中。之后,我们去了奥斯汀一个著名的美食车公园。这里的餐车提供了各种各样的美食,包括墨西哥塔克。烧烤和汉堡。我尝试了当地非常有名的塔克,它的味道真是美妙极了。塔克的外皮脆脆的,里面填满了鲜嫩的牛肉,蔬菜,香料和一些其他我不认识的东西。口感丰富,让我大快朵银。吃完后,我们还喝了几杯冰镇啤酒。坐在公园的长椅上,看着周围的人们聊天聚会,感受到一股轻松愉快的氛围。奥斯汀的美食和音乐一样,都充满着创意和多样性。给人一种无穷的惊喜。"

We haven't seen each other for several years, and this gathering has made me very excited. He lives in the dormitory of Tianjin University, where the campus is shaded by green trees and filled with a youthful and vibrant academic atmosphere. After arriving in Tianjin, my classmate warmly took me to visit his campus. Tianjin University has both modern teaching buildings and many historic buildings. The lakes and field roads on campus make people feel very comfortable. We visited the library he often goes to, where the environment is quiet and full of knowledge. He told me that many times he would spend the whole day here, burying himself in studying. During lunchtime, we went to a snack shop near the school to taste authentic Tianjin cuisine, such as Ruobi baozi and Jianbing guozi. These delicacies made my mouth full. My classmates also recommended Fried Dough Twists in Tianjin. In the afternoon, we went to Wuda Road in Tianjin, where there are many buildings of Yuejiu Yanglou. Strolling on the streets of Wuda Road, I feel as if I have traveled back to the last century and experienced the unique atmosphere of combining ancient and modern elements. Then we went to Jingyuan, which was the place where the last emperor Puyi once lived. Jingyuan is shaded by green trees, with a blend of Chinese and Western architectural styles that are very elegant and peaceful. Here, we sit on benches in the garden, learning about our future plans and dreams, as if time has returned to the days when we were still high school students. In the evening, we went to Tianjin Eye, which is a famous Ferris wheel in Tianjin. With the slow rise of the Ferris wheel, the beautiful scenery of the entire city is all in my eyes. The distant Haihe River shines brightly in the sunshine, and the towering buildings of the city complement each other. That moment filled me with love for this city. This trip to Tianjin not only allowed me to experience the beauty and culture of the city, but more importantly, I re established a connection with my old friends. The scenery, people, and cuisine of Tianjin make me linger and travel back and forth.","去年秋天,我去天津拜访了一位高中同学,他现在在天津大学读书,我们已经有好几年没见了,这次相聚让我非常期待。他住在天津大学宿舍里,校园内绿树成荫,充满了青春和活力的学术氛围。到了天津之后,我的同学热情地带我参观了他的校园,天津大学既有现代化的教学楼,也有许多历史悦久的建筑,校园里的湖泊和领域道让人感到非常舒适。我们参观了他常去的图书馆,那里环境安静而充满知识的气息。他告诉我,很多时候他会在这里度过整天,埋头学习。午饭时间,我们去了学校附近的一家小吃店,品尝地道的天津美食,比如果布里包子,煎饼果子,这些美食让我大饱口福。我的同学还特别推荐了天津麻花。下午,我们去了天津的武大道,这里有许多悦久洋楼的建筑。漫步在武大道的街道上,我仿佛穿越回了上世纪,感受到那种古老与现代结合的独特氛围。接着我们去了靖园,这是末代皇帝溥仪曾经居住过的地方。靖园里绿树成荫,建筑风格中西合璧,非常优雅宁静。在这里,我们坐在花园的长椅上,了解了未来的计划和梦想,仿佛时间回到了我们还是高中生的日子。傍晚时分,我们去了天津之眼,这是天津著名的摩天轮。随着摩天轮的缓缓升高,整个城市的美景尽瘦眼底,远处的海河在阳光下闪闪发光,城市的高楼大厦与过了建筑交相辉映,那一刻让我对这座城市充满了喜爱。这次天津之行,不仅让我体验了这座城市的美丽与文化,更重要的是我和老朋友重新建立了生活联系。天津的风景,人情和美食让我流连往返。"

This old man is one of the people I have recently planted. He not only taught me physics knowledge, but also made me understand the significance of science and the attitude towards life. I heard that he retired and I moved to a nursing home, and I have been wanting to visit him. Finally, on a winter afternoon, I embarked on this journey with full respect. Entering the courtyard of the nursing home, I saw the figure of the secretary at a glance. Professor Wang sat on a bench in the yard, draped in a blanket and holding a book in his hand. He carried his old flower sword and focused on reading the pages of the book, the sunlight shining on his slightly hooked body, appearing particularly quiet. Standing in front of him, I softly shouted, Teacher Wang! He lifted his head. I was stunned for a moment, then recognized me. A smile slowly bloomed on his face. His voice remained as gentle as ever. He stood up and patted my shoulder, as kind and affectionate as before. Finally, he took me into his room, although it was simple, it was decorated very neatly. Professor Wang poured me a cup of hot stir fry, and we sat down by the window, chatting about our lives over the years. Even after Professor Wang goes to bed, his life is still very fulfilling. He persists in reading every day and even tries to write articles, compiling his decades of teaching experience. He took out a notebook and showed it to me. It was filled with formulas and thoughts, and he was clear and organized. Although my legs and feet are not as good as before, I still need to use my brain. Learning is a lifelong thing. When he spoke, his eyes shone brightly, and his love for knowledge moved me deeply. I feel a myriad of emotions. I feel a myriad of emotions. We talked for a long time, from my current situation to my life choices. He always gently encouraged me and shared his experience. Time flies by so quickly that I have to say goodbye to him. He walked me to the door, stood under the sunset, and patted my shoulder. Work hard, the future belongs to you young people. As I walked out of the nursing home, the afterglow of the sunset scattered on the road. My heart is filled with emotion and strength. Professor Wang's life is like an open book. He told me through his actions that growth is not just about pursuing growth. It's just about pursuing external success. It is even more important to maintain inner persistence and desire. At that moment, I became even more determined about my direction.","几天前,我探访了一家养老院,去看望我的高中物理老师。这位老人是我最近种的人之一,他不仅教会了我物理知识,还让我明白了科学的意义与人生的态度。听说他退休了我搬到的养老院,我一直想去拜访他。终于,在一个冬日的下午,我带着满心的敬意踏上了这次旅程。进入养老院的院子,我一眼就看到了书记的身影。望教授坐在院子里的长椅上,身上披着一条毯子,手里拿着一本书。他带着老花剑,关注着看书页,阳光洒在他微微勾搂的身躯上,显得格外安静。站在他面前,我轻轻喊了一声,王老师!他抬起头。愣了一下,后认出我。笑容慢慢在他脸上绽放。他声音一如既往的温柔。他起身拍了拍我的肩膀,像当年一样慈祥又亲切。最后,他带我进了他的房间,虽然简单,但布置得十分整洁。望教授给我倒了一杯热炒,我们在窗边坐下,开始聊起了这些年的生活。望教授睡觉后,生活依然过得十分充实。他每天坚持阅读,还尝试写作文章,把自己几十年的教学经验整理下来。他拿出一本笔记给我看,上面一一麻麻记满了公式和思考,自己清晰而工整。虽然腿脚不如以前,但脑子还得用,学习是一辈子的事情。他说话时,眼里透着光,那种对知识的热爱,让我十分感动。我感感万千。我感感万千。我们聊了许久,从我现状到人生的选择。他始终温和地鼓励我,分享他的经验。时间过得过得飞快,我不得不与他道别。他送我走到门口,站在夕阳下,踩了拍我的肩膀。好好努力呀,未来属于你们年轻人。走出养老院时,夕阳余晖,洒在路上。我的心里满是感动与力量。望教授的一生,就像一本打开的书。他用行动告诉我,成长不仅是追求成长。也仅是追求外在的成功。更是保有内心的坚持与渴望。那一刻,我更加见定了自己的方向。"

I called out his name, and he looked up for a moment before revealing a big smile. Put down the toy and ran over to hug me. An Ge! His voice carried familiar blocks. I touched his head and found that he had grown much taller than I remembered, but those bright eyes were still filled with the innocence unique to children.

Holding his hand, he can only see that painting. Eyepoint said, this is An Ge! It's you! My heart felt a pang of sourness and warmth. I told him that he draws very well and should persevere. Nodding vigorously, his eyes filled with anticipation. Before leaving, he tightly held my hand and said, 'An Ge, will you come again?'. I crouched down and looked at him, answering solemnly. I will definitely bring your Uncle Wang to visit you. When I left the orphanage, I couldn't help but turn around and take a look. Haohao stood at the door, waving at me.

The weather that day was quite gloomy, with light rain and slippery roads, making it quite difficult for us to walk. But we didn't feel like giving up because of this, instead we enthusiastically continued to move forward. However, as we walked, we found ourselves lost and unfamiliar with the road next to us. The mud under my feet grew more and more, and then it started to fog up, and my vision became increasingly blurred. Then we kept looking for directions, but we couldn't be sure if we were going the right way. Just when we were feeling a bit hopeless, we suddenly noticed a small stream ahead. We know that following the water flow should be able to find the correct way out. So everyone cautiously followed the stream and finally found their way back to the starting point after a few hours. Although everyone is very tired and exhausted, the feeling of successfully returning to the road after challenging the limits makes us extremely satisfied. After returning home, we all felt very fulfilled and learned many methods on how to calmly think and solve problems in difficult situations.

We all love art, so we have planned our visit in advance. The exhibition on that day was also very exciting, with many works of art in different styles, some of which were quite unique and left a deep impression on me. I particularly like an abstract painting with rich colors. Every stroke and painting in this painting is filled with strong emotions, making me unconsciously immersed in it. While I was engrossed in admiring this painting, a stranger suddenly walked up to me and started chatting with me about the background of its creation. He told me that this painting was created by himself, and I was immediately stunned. I never expected that the person in front of me could be... the artist himself. After being surprised, we talked a lot. He explained to me every detail of this painting, including the choice of colors, the use of brushes, and the source of inspiration during the creative process. He also shared with us many insights and challenges related to artistic creation. Finally, he warmly invited me to attend his solo art exhibition. I am very surprised. Because this encounter not only deepened my understanding of art, but also made me realize that behind artistic works, there is often a great effort and emotional investment put in by artists. So this experience has made me feel that I have gained a deeper understanding of art, and it has also made me respect those artists who silently create.","我和我的几个朋友去参加一个周末的艺术展览,我们都挺喜欢艺术的,所以提前计划好参观。当天的展览的作品也非常精彩,有许多不同风格的艺术品,其中有一些挺独特的让我印象深刻。我特别喜欢一幅色彩丰富的抽象画,这幅画的每一笔每一画都充满了那种强烈的情感,让我不自觉的沉浸在其中。正在我专心欣赏这幅画的时候,一个陌生人突然走到我的旁边,开始和我聊起这幅画的创作背景。他告诉我这幅画是他自己放作的,我一下子就懵了。就完全没有想到眼前这位人很可能是……艺术家本人。吃惊过后,我们聊了很多,他向我解释了这幅画的每个细节,包括颜色的选择,画笔的运用,还有创作过程中这个灵感的来源。他还跟我们分享了许多关于艺术创作的心得和挑战。最后也是非常热情的邀请我参加他的个人画展。我感到非常的惊讶。因为这次偶遇不仅让我更加了解艺术,还让我意识到艺术作品背后往往隐藏着艺术家付出的巨大努力以及情感投入。所以这次经历让我觉得我对艺术有了更深的理解,也让我更加尊重那些默默创作的艺术家们。"
99,00100.wav,Chinese,True Story,"2021年,我去了一套农村,拜访我很久没见的表哥。表哥一家住在偏远的乡下,那里风景优美,四周都是起伏的山丘和广阔的田野,我已经很久没去那里了。所以,这次拜访让我感到既兴奋又怀念。到达村子那天,表哥开着他的小拖拉机来接我。村子的路不宽,但沿途两边的景色非常美丽,尤其是那大片的油菜花田。金黄色的花海一望无际,仿佛为大地铺上了一层温暖的产子。表哥一路上兴致勃勃地给我介绍村里的每一处变化,比如新修的桥梁,邻居家刚建好的新房,还有村里最近新开的农产品合作社。虽然村子没有城市的高楼大厦和繁忙的街道,但这种宁静简单的生活氛围让我感到非常放松。到家后,表哥的父母非常热情,给我端来了新鲜的水果和自家做的米酒。表哥的母亲很快就开始准备晚饭,我看到她从小院里带来了新鲜的蔬菜。那些蔬菜颜色翠绿,充满了生机。晚餐非常丰盛,有煮的鲜嫩的鸡汤,自家腌制的咸菜,还有刚从地里挖出来的土豆,特别香甜。这顿饭让我想起了小时候和家人们一起吃饭的情景。那种简单而充满爱的感觉,似乎让我的心一下子回到了过去。吃完饭后,表哥提议带我去村里的河边钓鱼,我们拿上竹竿和蚯蚓,走了十几分钟的田野小路来到了村外的那条小河边。河水非常清澈,水面上倒映着蓝茶。天河周围的树木,微风拂过,水面泛起层层涟漪,我找了一块大石头,坐下,把鱼饵抛进河中,然后静静地等,带着鱼饵上钩。河面非常安静,只能听到树叶被风吹动的沙沙声和几只蟋蟀的鸣叫声。我和表哥有一句没一句地聊着近况,聊到小时候我们一起玩捉迷藏的日子,那时候我们还小,无忧无虑,整个世界都像是我们的游乐场。表哥回忆起那些年我们偷吃邻居家葡萄的趣事,他说着便大笑起来,我也不禁笑出了声,仿佛那段美好的时光就在眼前。夜渐渐深了,我们没有钓到很多鱼,但这并不重要,我们坐在星空下,看着天上的星星一闪一闪,听着远处传来的几声蛙鸣,心里充满了宁静。表哥告诉我,他虽然生活在农村,但他对这样的生活很满意,他喜欢田野里的自由,喜欢劳作的踏实感,也喜欢与家人和邻里之间的温暖互动。我能感觉到,他的话语中带着对生活的热爱和对家乡的深情。那一晚,我和表哥谈了很多。也想了很多,虽然我们生活在不同的环境中,但彼此之间那份血浓于水的亲情始终没有改变。我深深感受到,乡村生活虽然没有繁华的都市光景,却有一种城市难以找到的宁静与温情。这次拜访让我更加珍惜这段难得的亲情,也让我重新认识到真正的快乐往往来源于简单而真实的生活。","In 2021, I went to a rural area to visit my cousin whom I hadn't seen in a long time. My cousin's family lives in a remote countryside with beautiful scenery, surrounded by undulating hills and vast fields. I haven't been there for a long time. So, this visit made me feel both excited and nostalgic. On the day I arrived at the village, my cousin came to pick me up in his small tractor. The road in the village is not wide, but the scenery on both sides along the way is very beautiful, especially the large rapeseed fields. The golden flower sea stretches endlessly, as if laying a warm layer of fertility on the earth. My cousin enthusiastically introduced me to every change in the village along the way, such as the newly built bridge, the neighbor's newly built house, and the recently opened agricultural cooperative in the village. Although the village does not have the high-rise buildings and busy streets of the city, this peaceful and simple living atmosphere makes me feel very relaxed. After arriving home, my cousin's parents were very enthusiastic and brought me fresh fruits and homemade rice wine. My cousin's mother quickly started preparing dinner, and I saw her bringing fresh vegetables from the small courtyard. Those vegetables are green in color and full of vitality. The dinner was very sumptuous, with fresh and tender chicken soup cooked, pickled vegetables marinated at home, and freshly dug potatoes, especially sweet and fragrant. This meal reminds me of eating with my family when I was a child. That simple and loving feeling seemed to take my heart back to the past. After dinner, my cousin suggested taking me fishing by the river in the village. We took bamboo poles and earthworms and walked a field path for more than ten minutes to the small river outside the village. The river water is very clear, with blue tea reflecting on the surface. The trees around Tianhe were swaying gently, causing ripples on the water surface. I found a large stone, sat down, threw the bait into the river, and waited quietly, taking the bait with me. The river is very quiet, only the rustling sound of leaves being blown by the wind and the chirping of a few crickets can be heard. My cousin and I were chatting about our recent situation, talking about the days when we played hide and seek together as children. At that time, we were still young, carefree, and the whole world was like our playground. My cousin recalled the funny stories of us stealing grapes from our neighbor's house in those years. As he spoke, he burst out laughing, and I couldn't help but laugh out loud, as if that beautiful time was right in front of me. As the night grew deeper, we didn't catch many fish, but that didn't matter. We sat under the starry sky, watching the stars twinkle in the sky and listening to the distant croaks of frogs, our hearts filled with tranquility. My cousin told me that although he lives in the countryside, he is very satisfied with this kind of life. He likes the freedom in the fields, the sense of security in working, and the warm interaction with his family and neighbors. I can feel that his words carry a love for life and deep affection for his hometown. That night, my cousin and I talked a lot. I have thought a lot about it, even though we live in different environments, the blood thicker than water bond between us has never changed. I deeply feel that although rural life does not have the bustling urban scenery, there is a kind of tranquility and warmth that cities cannot find. This visit has made me cherish this rare family bond even more, and has also made me realize that true happiness often comes from simple and authentic life.","2021年,我去了一套农村,拜访我很久没见的表哥。表哥一家住在偏远的乡下,那里风景优美,四周都是起伏的山丘和广阔的田野,我已经很久没去那里了。所以,这次拜访让我感到既兴奋又怀念。到达村子那天,表哥开着他的小拖拉机来接我。村子的路不宽,但沿途两边的景色非常美丽,尤其是那大片的油菜花田。金黄色的花海一望无际,仿佛为大地铺上了一层温暖的产子。表哥一路上兴致勃勃地给我介绍村里的每一处变化,比如新修的桥梁,邻居家刚建好的新房,还有村里最近新开的农产品合作社。虽然村子没有城市的高楼大厦和繁忙的街道,但这种宁静简单的生活氛围让我感到非常放松。到家后,表哥的父母非常热情,给我端来了新鲜的水果和自家做的米酒。表哥的母亲很快就开始准备晚饭,我看到她从小院里带来了新鲜的蔬菜。那些蔬菜颜色翠绿,充满了生机。晚餐非常丰盛,有煮的鲜嫩的鸡汤,自家腌制的咸菜,还有刚从地里挖出来的土豆,特别香甜。这顿饭让我想起了小时候和家人们一起吃饭的情景。那种简单而充满爱的感觉,似乎让我的心一下子回到了过去。吃完饭后,表哥提议带我去村里的河边钓鱼,我们拿上竹竿和蚯蚓,走了十几分钟的田野小路来到了村外的那条小河边。河水非常清澈,水面上倒映着蓝茶。天河周围的树木,微风拂过,水面泛起层层涟漪,我找了一块大石头,坐下,把鱼饵抛进河中,然后静静地等,带着鱼饵上钩。河面非常安静,只能听到树叶被风吹动的沙沙声和几只蟋蟀的鸣叫声。我和表哥有一句没一句地聊着近况,聊到小时候我们一起玩捉迷藏的日子,那时候我们还小,无忧无虑,整个世界都像是我们的游乐场。表哥回忆起那些年我们偷吃邻居家葡萄的趣事,他说着便大笑起来,我也不禁笑出了声,仿佛那段美好的时光就在眼前。夜渐渐深了,我们没有钓到很多鱼,但这并不重要,我们坐在星空下,看着天上的星星一闪一闪,听着远处传来的几声蛙鸣,心里充满了宁静。表哥告诉我,他虽然生活在农村,但他对这样的生活很满意,他喜欢田野里的自由,喜欢劳作的踏实感,也喜欢与家人和邻里之间的温暖互动。我能感觉到,他的话语中带着对生活的热爱和对家乡的深情。那一晚,我和表哥谈了很多。也想了很多,虽然我们生活在不同的环境中,但彼此之间那份血浓于水的亲情始终没有改变。我深深感受到,乡村生活虽然没有繁华的都市光景,却有一种城市难以找到的宁静与温情。这次拜访让我更加珍惜这段难得的亲情,也让我重新认识到真正的快乐往往来源于简单而真实的生活。"
